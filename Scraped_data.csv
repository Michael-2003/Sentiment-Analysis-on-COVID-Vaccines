7,radfemblack,"['I‚Äôm critical of ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù when it comes to the pandemic and the vaccines. On one hand. The reaction of governments has been very suspect. And the increasingly draconian measures being taken to enforce lockdown and get people vaccinated is scary. It begs the question, does something that is truly for our own good warrant all of these lies, all of this fearmongering, manipulation, and coercion? How anyone who raises any questions about the way things are going is immediately jumped upon and demonized raises big red flags. Do we really believe that the pandemic has been handled 100% perfectly? And that‚Äôs not even to get into how race intersects with healthcare. Black and indigenous people have a long history of being used as test monkeys in experimental procedures, which creates a lot of distrust in the medical establishment ‚Äî this is something that‚Äôs not being addressed enough.', 'Full disclosure, I am double vaccinated. I initially didn‚Äôt want to take the vaccine because of all of the side effects I heard about, but I had to in order to go to school. Apart from some very watery diarrhea after the first dose, I have had no adverse reactions (yet). Now that I have it I‚Äôm glad to have taken the vaccine, I feel safer now. For a while I continued to worry a fair bit, but someone unexpectedly convinced me of this vax right now: Donald Trump. Donald Trump going against Candace Owens on vaccines is a pretty solid indication that they‚Äôre good. Trump could have taken the easy opportunity to stir up partisan politics but he didn‚Äôt. So this isn‚Äôt some ‚Äúliberal elite‚Äù agenda, outside of some far-fetched scenario this must be serious.', 'Now, as for the ‚Äúantivaxxers‚Äù and ‚Äúantimaskers‚Äù. I think they have some points, as I said before, but I think most of them are just driven by partisan contrarianism. And the absolute fucking victim mentality a lot of them have! I can‚Äôt fucking stand these mfs with their goofy and lame ass comparisons to segregation and the Holocaust. Stop. Just fucking stop. It‚Äôs like when trans activists try to piggyback on white supremacy to advance their bullshit. None of you better open your mouths to compare yourselves with the poor set upon negroes when you don‚Äôt give a shit about us outside of our utility as your rhetorical prop. If you want to argue that it‚Äôs unethical for the government to coercively impose medical procedures on people, that‚Äôs one thing. But this is a false equivalency. Your vaccination status is something you can change, my skin color is not. If your argument really is solid then it can stand on its own. ']"

16,afoldintime,"['Before we get into the study, let‚Äôs define two key terms:', 'Since herd immunity hasn‚Äôt been achieved anywhere for Covid-19 yet, the herd immunity threshold has to be calculated theoretically. Using the theoretical formula, scientists initially estimated the herd immunity threshold to be around 60-67% for the population of Manaus, Brazil, where the pandemic has hit extremely hard.\xa0', 'In order to assess where the attack rate was in relation to the theoretical herd immunity threshold, the scientists tested for the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood donations in Manaus from February through October 2020. (Data from diagnostic Covid tests cannot be used to accurately approximate the attack rate, since it‚Äôs unknown how much of the population was infected but were never tested.) As a check, they compared their calculated attack rates with the reported mortality rates in Manaus over the time period, and the two were well-correlated.\xa0', 'Based on their data, scientists estimated that the attack rate in Manaus had reached 76% by October 2020. Now remember, when herd immunity is achieved, that means there are no new infections in the population. However, although the Manaus attack rate of 76% is greater than the theoretical herd immunity threshold of 60-67%, there continue to be Covid-19 infections in Manaus. Herd immunity in Manaus has not been achieved.\xa0', 'The infection fatality rate for Manaus in this time period is estimated to be between 0.17-0.28%, which equates to 4.5 excess mortality. Here‚Äôs the concerning part: the population of Manaus actually skews young, so the fatality rate is lower than we would expect in other parts of the world. Adjusted for population demographics, if the 76% attack rate in Manaus were to be replicated in other parts of the world, an estimated 350K people would die in the UK, and 1.5 million people would die in the US, and herd immunity would still not be achieved. Therefore, vaccines are necessary in order to achieve herd immunity from Covid-19.\xa0', 'Although I am a scientist, my area of expertise is not epidemiology. I‚Äôve read this paper in its entirety and believe I‚Äôve extracted the most important parts, but if you see I‚Äôve said something wrong, please do correct me so we are not spreading false information!', 'Additionally, if anyone has questions about Covid-19, the vaccine, or related topics, please feel free to send me an ask or DM.

33,a4bl,"['The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a new surge in violence against Asian communities across the world. Several high-profile instances of anti-Asian racist violence‚Äîspurred on by casually racist remarks at every level of government, business, and popular culture‚Äîhave created a terrorizing climate for many. In San Francisco Chinatown for example, overt xenophobia, combined with the economic impact of shelter-in-place orders, has left immigrants, elders, limited English-speaking people, and poor folks feeling like targets. In San Francisco, where a staggeringly disproportionate 50% of the COVID-19 mortalities are from the Asian and Pacific Islander community, the pandemic has ushered in multiple violences. This has been further exacerbated by pre-existing crises: gentrification, displacement, homelessness, police terror, inequities in education, a drastic uptick in deportations, antagonism against trans and queer people, poverty, and exploitation.\xa0', 'Nationally, Black people are dying from COVID-19 at rates twice as high as other groups, an outcome of deeply embedded structural racism in healthcare, housing, labor, and other policies. Communities are weakened from decades of housing discrimination and redlining, forced denser housing, targeted criminalization and incarceration, larger numbers of pre-existing health conditions, and less access to affordable healthy food. Black communities are more likely to live in places with air pollution, rely on public transit, and be essential workers, so exposure rates increase. When Black people fall ill with COVID-19, racism in the healthcare system means lack of access to quality care, testing kits, or funds for treatment. In some cases, like for Zoe Mungin, they are simply not believed and turned away from treatment, until it is too late.\xa0', 'We must recognize that the scapegoating of Asians as the harbingers of disease and the state violence against Black people (via systemic policing and state response to the pandemic) are two sides of the same coin. This system of oppression is what indicates whether we live or die. This moment makes it even clearer that we must radicalize our communities for cross-racial solidarity.\xa0', 'Asians and Anti-Blackness in the US', 'Asians in the US are not a monolith. Some of us are first-generation immigrants who came here to work under selective immigration policies that privileged our education and technical skills. Some of us are here through involuntary migrations‚Äîfleeing economic and military wars waged in our homelands by the US and other imperial powers. Some of our Asian families have been in the US for generations. Some of us were adopted from Asian countries by non-Asian families. Some of us are mixed-race and of Black and Asian descent. We cannot ignore the varied experiences and distinctions between how our people got to this land, our familial and community histories in the US, and the way in which mainstream American perceptions and portrayals impact us differently. What we do have in common is that we‚Äôre incentivized by capitalism and racism, particularly anti-Blackness, to hold up the dual evils of white supremacy and American imperialism.', 'In order to fight back, we need to be more informed. That means understanding how we‚Äôve been asked to buy into this system and to uphold ideas, policies, and practices that ultimately go against our interests. That also means being active and vocal supporters of Black liberation, and taking responsibility to end our anti-Blackness. We must acknowledge that anti-Blackness is at the core of all racism and that non-Black Asians have benefited‚Äîconditionally‚Äîfrom a system of anti-Blackness politically, economically, and socially. See our statement on recent police killings of Black people for more on this. It also means understanding how the history of racial capitalism has impacted all our communities and continues to impact us.', 'A Shared History of White Supremacy and Imperialism', ""Today the current administration is seeding a second Cold War with China to protect its financial interests globally and in the Asian Pacific. Stateside, we see results of this expressed as public figures repeatedly call COVID-19 a ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù or a ‚ÄúKung Flu,‚Äù directly resulting in vigilante attacks on people of Chinese descent, or people perceived to be of Chinese descent. In the summer, we‚Äôre seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as states push for ‚Äúre-opening,‚Äù in part so that the state doesn't have to pay the brunt of unemployment benefits. This puts frontline workers (who are disproportionately from communities of color) at further risk‚Äîa decision not made off science but because of the drive for profit. In 2014-15, the Ebola outbreak also became a racialized pandemic, sparking widespread fear of African countries and a globalized anti-Blackness by Western countries."", 'We‚Äôve seen this before: racist rhetoric, scapegoating, and, eventually, military tactics that target and intimidate communities of color to reinforce US capitalist priorities domestically and imperialism abroad. During World War II, fear of military threat by the Japanese government and fear of the economic influence of people of Japanese descent in the US led to the racist mass incarceration of Japanese Americans. Despite this despicable history, racist pundits have recently claimed the incarceration of Japanese Americans actually sets legal precedent for the targeting of other communities of color in the post 9-11 era. US government officials used Southwest Asian, North African, Muslim and South Asian communities as scapegoats during the ‚ÄúWar on Terror‚Äù which put a huge target on their backs for vigilante violence, created massive surveillance and state-sanctioned harassment programs, and provided a cover for starting endless wars in the Gulf and West Asia for geopolitical dominance. During the rhetoric leading up to the various iterations of Trump‚Äôs travel bans we saw xenophobic language like ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù targeting both Muslim and African countries. We know that within the system of immigration surveillance and detention, Black immigrants are disproportionately targeted and deported.\xa0', 'We also know that the modern US police force was created in the antebellum period as patrols to hunt down people escaping slavery. Their present-day incarnation has been further solidified through continued targeting of Black communities as well as cracking down on unions and workers fighting for fairer wages and decent working conditions. Similarly, prisons are the contemporary progenies of slave plantations. These systems are undergirded by a dominant white supremacist narrative that insinuates Black people are inherently criminal and Black communities and families are irreparably broken. These narratives‚Äîbuilt on more than 500\xa0 years of slavery, Indigenous genocide, and the theft of Native land‚Äîprotect white owning-class privilege and power while resulting in death, disempowerment, and suffering, which disproportionately impact Black and Indigenous communities. These dominant systems, and the narratives that support them, have a firm grip on every aspect of contemporary US life. Understanding these critical connections is required political education for all‚Äîa more strategic resistance enables growth and strength across multiple communities of struggle. Without this, our communities are more vulnerable to counterproductive responses.', 'Moving Away from Counterproductive Responses', 'Unfortunately, in response to the rise in anti-Asian violence during COVID-19, we‚Äôve seen vigilante groups form, bent on taking matters into their own hands. These responses reinforce the violent systems and narratives we want to dismantle. One such group that we‚Äôve learned about in San Francisco Chinatown is composed of some ex-military. They have claimed they would perform citizens‚Äô arrests, and have surveilled people they deem ‚Äúsuspicious,‚Äù\xa0 and called the cops on them. Based on historic biases of the police and military, the folks targeted by this vigilante group have been Black, poor, unhoused, disabled, or a combination of the above. As we‚Äôve seen for decades, police kill Black people at rates six times that of white people. This group has even co-opted language from the movement for Black lives in order to seem more sympathetic. Utilizing policing tactics like ‚Äúpatrols‚Äù and engaging in military-style surveillance and harassment of Black and poor people is an escalation and expansion of violence‚Äînot successful harm-prevention.\xa0', 'In this moment of the pandemic and uprisings, there is an opportunity to pivot to the future our communities want and need. Rather than attempting to solve the issues we‚Äôre facing by using tactics that replicate harm, we ask ourselves and each other: What new systems of support and care can we build and grow so that the world can be better? Asians cannot afford to hold on to the meager protections given to us by white supremacy; we can no longer be conscripted to fight the battles of white supremacy and American imperialism on its behalf while simultaneously being harmed by these systems. We need to recognize that our liberation is tied to our interdependence and solidarity.\xa0', 'Our Liberation is Intertwined', 'Hyejin Shim, queer Korean and prison abolitionist, poses an essential question: ‚ÄúWhat are the legacies we‚Äôve inherited, which ones will we choose to protect?‚Äù In her piece questioning the limits of Asian American allyship, Hyejin reminds us that as Asian Americans, we have a rich, deep legacy of ‚ÄúAsian American prison abolitionists, anti-war activists, racial justice organizers, disability justice freedom fighters, queer/trans feminists & anti fascists, immigrant rights organizers, housing justice organizers, rape and domestic violence survivor advocates, labor organizers, artists and cultural workers, movement lawyers, and so many more, from both the past & present.‚Äù In all of these movements, Asian Americans have struggled alongside their Black siblings, with an understanding that our liberations are intertwined.', 'Again, Black and Asian solidarity in the face of systemic oppression is not new and we should continue to draw lessons from our vibrant shared history to inform our current and future work organizing for a more just society.', '(For more on the above examples, check out these zines by Bianca Mabute-Louie!)', 'Grounding in Interdependence and Solidarity', 'In addition to deepening our understanding of our shared histories, we should deepen our interpersonal relationships‚Äîour trust. We should continue to build out the mechanisms through which we tangibly support each other. As Stacey Park Milbern‚Äîa dearly beloved queer mixed race Korean comrade and disability justice movement leader who recently passed away‚Äîtaught us: ‚ÄúWe live and love interdependently. We know no person is an island, we need one another to live.‚Äù', 'This month, hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets, decrying the police murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many more. The people are mobilizing to uplift calls from Black organizers to defund the police while imagining and implementing alternatives to policing that actually promote community health and wellbeing. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight to behold and we must not forget that this incredible and rapid mass mobilization is a direct result of the tireless and intentional work of organizers who move in between these flashpoint moments: people who do the unsung work of cultivating and deepening interpersonal relationships over decades, holding difficult and educational conversations, supporting members through personal challenges, and creating venues for community to celebrate victories and accomplishments.', 'Deep, intentional relationship building is central to laying the foundations that make change possible; at the same time, it is not just a means to an end. Trust and interdependence are ends in themselves. As Asians 4 Black Lives, we aim to live out the world we are fighting for, and our deep comradeship and friendship is core to how and why we show up. For example, we have taken up the practice of beginning each of our regular meetings with personal check-ins: Do you have any needs that our community can help you with? Do you have any resources or bandwidth you can offer to community? We are often wrestling with the complexity of what it means to be people of Asian diaspora living in the United States and in joint struggle with our Black, Indigenous, and other comrades of color. This extends our questioning into deeper political territory: What, if any, is our role as US-based Asians in addressing anti-Blackness in Asian communities abroad? What does it mean to be called #Asians4BlackLives when that phrase is being used as a rallying cry for so many who express their solidarity in ways we may not be aligned with? Our work raises important questions that help us sharpen our analysis and build stronger ties with each other and the communities we are accountable to.', 'Whatever the world throws at us, be it interpersonal violence, a novel coronavirus, climate change, or vigilante racism, we know that communities are most resilient when basic needs are met. As others have noted, wealthy, predominantly white communities have much lower rates of policing and longer life expectancies than lower income communities of color. This isn‚Äôt because rich people or white people are less predisposed to do harm, or because they are physically or biologically predetermined to be healthier, but rather that these communities are allocated more resources and support structures. These communities are given more chances to address violence without being criminalized, but this often empowers people with privilege to continue causing harm without facing consequences. Instead of this model, we strive for a world where everyone‚Äôs needs are met and new systems help us address real issues of health and harm without relying on the carceral state.', '\xa0The good news is we‚Äôre seeing more and more Asian communities move towards redistributing resources of time, money, and energy in this moment. Asian volunteers are phonebanking and getting donations pledged to Black groups‚Äîdirectly. Asians are encouraging each other to speak to their families and communities. Asians are supporting the campaigns and creative direct action efforts of Black-led groups to win the defunding and abolition of police and prisons. Asians are setting up strong alternatives to relying on these systems for safety. It is a powerful moment of mobilization.', 'As COVID-19 shifts social relations in unprecedented ways and oppressive forces leverage the pandemic to stir up fear and anti-Asian racism for their own benefit, we must resist the temptation to put up walls and isolate ourselves. It‚Äôs essential that we be resilient and creative in the ways we stay close. Let us continue to deepen our trust and ground ourselves in our rich legacies of solidarity. Let us leverage our collectivizing strength as we fight for a world that centers humanity, dignity, and the space to thrive.']"

44,a-typical,"[""This is false. There is likely, in fact, a propensity for some viruses to trend towards fewer fatalities and fewer symptoms over time. But notice all the caveats I used in that sentence. The basic mechanism we're talking about is that it is bad for viruses to kill their hosts. A dead host cannot replicate a virus. However, that is a slow process that is governed by the random chance of evolution. It can be in a virus's best interest to become more deadly if that mutation also increases transmissibility. We're seeing this with the delta variant right now. It is both more transmissible and more deadly, and it is outcompeting the original variant."", ""If a virus mutated into a variant that gave it a huge advantage in how transmissible it is over all other circulating variants but also made it 100% fatal at 1 year post-infection, it's going to spread like wildfire even though it's highly fatal. The only thing that mattered to it outcompeting other viruses is how efficiently it spreads, as long as it kills you slower than it can spread from organism to organism it's going to do just fine for itself."", ""Ebola is a pretty efficient killer, yet it also spreads just rapidly enough to stay ahead of the host's death. Covid is even worse on the infectivity front because you're contagious for days or weeks without knowing it, spreading the virus the entire time. If covid became 50% fatal but it took 2 weeks to kill you, it's going to spread just as rapidly as a 1% fatal variant. Now, if the 50% fatal variant kills you in 3 days but took 5 to become highly contagious, well it might not spread fast enough to find new hosts and it would burn out. So far, that isn't what is happening with covid."", ""I've noticed this idea about how viruses always mutate to lower lethality showing up everywhere recently, and it's just a stupid feel-good lie people are telling themself. As long as the virus can find more hosts before the current one dies, its overall lethality doesn't matter.""]"

47,theonlinevegan,"['On the face of it, there might seem to be little relationship between  veganism and COVID-19. The virus is not spread by eating animal  products, and nor is there any reason to believe that vegans are less  likely to catch it. However, there are two important senses in which  COVID-19 clearly is related to veganism. ', 'The first is that COVID-19 originated, as best as we can tell, from a  so-called ‚Äòwet market‚Äô, where animals are kept and slaughtered for food.  These environments, like factory farms, are prime breeding grounds for  zoonotic diseases. These are diseases ‚Äì like COVID-19, SARS, bird ‚Äòflu,  swine ‚Äòflu, and more ‚Äì that leap from nonhuman animals to humans. Of  course, wet markets and factory farms would not exist if the whole world  was vegan. This crucial point is being acknowledged, though sometimes  only reluctantly, in the press. However, this link between veganism and  COVID-19 is being made by both activists and academics in increasing  numbers. ', 'At the start of March ‚Äì a few days before the first COVID-19 death in  the UK ‚Äì the vegan philosophers Paolo Cavalieri and Peter Singer called  for a global ban on wet markets. ‚ÄòFor the animals, wet markets are hell  on earth‚Äô ‚Äì and, as COVID-19 (and other zoonotic diseases show), these  wet markets can be terrible for humans, too. A ban on wet markets, then,  is a chance to benefit both humans and animals. ', 'On Easter Monday, David Benatar, a South African philosopher (and  vegan), published a column in the New York Times called ‚ÄòOur Cruel  Treatment of Animals Led to the Coronavirus‚Äô, in which he discussed how  we could have prevented COVID-19, and how we could prevent similar  outbreaks in the future. He argued that ', 'Real prevention requires taking steps to minimize the chances of the  virus or other infectious agents emerging in the first place. One of a  number of crucial measures would be a more intelligent ‚Äî and more  compassionate ‚Äî appraisal of our treatment of nonhuman animals, and  concomitant action. ', 'Cavalieri, Singer, and Benatar are all pointing to this first link  between COVID-19 and veganism: If we were all vegan, there would be no  wet markets or factory farms from which viruses could emerge. ', 'This does not necessarily mean that there would be no pandemics. Health  crises could emerge from other areas of human-animal contact, or emerge  in ways completely unrelated to animals. But there is every reason to  believe that a vegan world would be one with far fewer pandemics ‚Äì and  it would almost certainly be one without COVID-19. ', 'There is, I think, another link between veganism and COVID-19, and one  less widely acknowledged. COVID-19 lockdowns around the world show us  that when thousands of human lives are on the line, we are collectively  willing to make drastic changes to our lifestyles, affecting our  day-to-day activities, our economy, our education systems, and much  more. ', 'Perhaps we should be willing to make another collective shift in our  daily lives. Perhaps we should, as a society, as a global community,  transition away from diets containing animal products, and towards  veganism. ', 'This shift towards veganism ‚Äì like the COVID-19 lockdown ‚Äì has the  potential to save many, many human lives. First, it will severely reduce  the threat of future pandemics, as discussed above. But second, it will  severely reduce the threat of other human health crises associated with  animal agriculture, like antibiotic resistance. Here is Benatar again: ', 'In addition to future pandemics, we face the very real risk of breeding  antibiotic resistance. The major contributor to this is the use of  antibiotics in the animal agriculture industry, as a growth promoter (to  bring animals to slaughter weight as quickly as possible) and to curb  the spread of infections among animals reared in cruel intensive  ‚Äúfactory farmed‚Äù conditions. ‚Ä¶ It is entirely possible that the human  future will involve a return to the pre-antibiotics era, in which people  died in droves from infections that have been effectively treated since  the discovery of penicillin and other early antibacterial agents. ‚Ä¶ We,  as a species, know about this problem, but we have not yet done what  needs to be done to avert it (or at least minimize the chances of its  happening). ', 'Animal agriculture is also very bad for the environment, and this  reveals a third set of reasons that a shift towards veganism will save  human lives. Take greenhouse gases as an example. Greenhouse-gas  emissions are contributing to the global climate crisis, which can,  does, and will devastate human lives. A 2014 study led by Peter  Scarborough ‚Äì a population-health expert at the University of Oxford ‚Äì  found that, in the UK, the diet of a typical UK meat-eating adult  (classified in the study as a high-meat diet) resulted in greenhouse-gas  emissions 2.5 times that of a typical UK vegan. ', 'So greenhouse gases are very bad for environment, and thus very bad for  humans. Meanwhile, non-vegan diets are associated with very high  greenhouse-gas emissions. Unsurprisingly, then, a shift to a vegan diet  could save many millions of human lives in the coming decades due to the  positive environmental impact. A 2016 study, led by Marco Springmann  (another population-health expert at Oxford) found that a worldwide  shift towards plant-based diets could result in up to 70% lower  food-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. This lowering of  emissions, combined with the improvement of the healthfulness of diets  (a fourth reason a shift towards veganism will save lives), could result  ‚Äì the authors calculated ‚Äì in up to 10% lower mortality per year in  2050. The authors worked out that the economic benefit of this lower  mortality rate could be up to US$31 trillion a year ‚Äì or up to 13% of  the global gross domestic product. ', 'All of this shows just how many human lives are at stake in the  collective decisions we make about what we should and should not be  eating. And this is a collective decision. This is not just an  individual decision about what we put in our mouths ‚Äì this is a  collective, political decision that has huge impacts on population  health, mortality rates, and the economy. ', 'Collectively, we have shown ourselves willing to make very drastic  changes to our lifestyles to save human lives in response to COVID-19.  We should, I believe, also be willing to make the much less drastic  change of moving away from animal-based foods and towards plant-based  diets to save human lives. And not only human lives. A widespread shift  to veganism could, as I have argued, save many millions of human lives.  But it would also save untold trillions of animals. What are we waiting  for? ']"

They said that they could not inform us about personal details, including these peopels last movements, and that the areas where they had been were cleaned properly with staff dressed in the appropriate ppe. They emphasized that there would be no changes to the plan to continue a blended educational experience where only some of our classes would be on campus in person. Then today, the day before the semester starts; someone in the grouchat for my entire accomodation complex texted and said that they had just tested positive. I read the message on the bus back home. By the time I had made it home, and just started on my dinner my flatmates started puring in as well. By then there was second hand information about at least one other confimed case. Then one of my flatmates who was smoking outside said he had been in contact with one of these people and as a side note, that he coudn‚Äôt taste the cigarette he was smoking currently. He left to get tested very soon after that. A few hours later my track and trace app notified me of a possible exposure. After I texted a friend to inform her, she said another friend of hers said that her flatmate had tested positive as well. They had been hanging out a few days earlier. Another friend i was hanging out with yesterday said her sense of smell is gone, and she‚Äôs getting a test tomorrow. Her flatmate was coughing a bit.

This is actually not as surprising as one might think though, considering that the conditions people are subject to during these times are very different from our normal daily lives (in that they are more stressful and put people in less financially and emotionally stable positions. The massive amounts of death (brought on by the pandemic) may also have an effect on any person's mindset, as experiencing the death of a friend or family member can be a very stressful event in a person‚Äôs life. Let‚Äôs take a look at how this pandemic has affected the emotions of the general public."", 'At the start of the covid19 pandemic, the general consensus was that the quarantine and isolation would not stay a societal norm for long, and that soon after 2-3 weeks, life would return to its relative normalcy. However, it has now been almost 6 months since the stay at home orders were implemented and we are all still stuck at home, with very few states having their citizens return to school or work. According to the CDC, social distancing and other types of disease prevention methods that limit social contact can lead to a person feeling isolated, as if they have no one to talk to or vent out their frustrations with (source 1). The sensation of constant isolation and loneliness can have a considerably taxing effect on the human mind, especially to those who use social contact as a coping mechanism for stress. In addition to this, the pandemic, being an experience unlike any other to most people, has also brought on unique forms of paranoia and fear. An example of such a fear would be the idea of contracting covid19 (or a loved one contracting it). I personally have experienced this one a few times, as I have grandparents that are at high risk for covid19, and I know that many students can relate to this.\xa0', 'On top of the feeling of Isolation and fear of loved ones contracting the virus, the covid19 pandemic has also brought on new stresses to students of all different ages. Speaking from experience, many AP students this year were extremely stressed over their scores thanks to the changes to the exam. On top of this, preparation for these tests was made much more difficult now that teachers could not meet in person with their students, so we had the added stress of having to put in more time than usual. Furthermore, the uncertainty of where our schools would take our learning next made many of my friends and I very anxious about the coming year. It almost felt like during this ordeal we were lacking the feeling of complete relaxation and lack of worry, which is detrimental for anyone‚Äôs mental health. Luckily, this year our school has given us a clear cut schedule and provided us with much more resources than last year, but I can‚Äôt say the same for other students throughout the states. This uncertainty has unfortunately also reached the college admissions process, as thanks to the updated requirements, it feels like much more of a gamble then it ever has been. As for the students in these universities, there is an increasing frustration brought on by the fact that most top level schools will still be charging full tuition for online school (which provides a significantly lower quality of education). In general, students across the nation are filled with great concern over their academic future.\xa0', 'These added stressors, coupled with the lack of coping mechanisms such as physical exercise (closed gyms) and social interactions, have also made people turn to substance abuse and increased their symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression/anxiety (according to the CDC). From surveys taken on June 24-30, the CDC found that at least 26.3% of adults aged 18+ have admitted to suffering from mental trauma or stress caused by factors related to covid19 (Source 2). In addition to this, around 13.3% have also admitted to substance use as a way of coping with their declining mental health. This is pretty alarming, considering that alcohol can actually negatively affect/suppress the immune system, making you more vulnerable to infections diseases like the coronavirus (Source 3).\xa0', 'So how can we combat this overall decline in mental health? One thing that the CDC does recommend is to reduce the time we spend listening to the news, as hearing too many negative stories can increase the stress levels in a person drastically (Source 1). Other good mental health practices (that generally work to lower stress even when there isn‚Äôt a pandemic affecting the world) include meditation, getting adequate sleep, and to actually avoid substance use. As far as stress caused by lack of social contact, technological means of communication such as phone calls, video calls, and even messengers can help to ease the feeling of loneliness in a time social distancing is the norm. For extremely dire situations, we also have hotlines such as the Suicide Prevention Hotline that work to help people in mental crises, and prevent the worst from happening. The mental health of many Americans may be poor right now, but with our resources and current understanding of the human mind, we can definitely combat the stress in ways that seek to promote our well being.', 'For more information on this topic, check out these three great resources on mental health during covid19:', '1.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html', '2.https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm', '3.https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/alcohol-and-covid-19#myths-vs-facts', 'The YUNiversity Interns | YUNiversity Writing Dept. | YUNiversity Art Dept.

And one such research is if we can use nanotechnology to help us fight against this dreadful covid-19. The perspectives of implementation of antiviral nano systems by experts to fight Covid-19 are still being envisioned.\xa0', 'In the structure of this coronavirus, there are 4 proteins ‚Äì Spike, envelope, membrane and a nucleocapsid. The spike protein is responsible for attaching itself to the host cell. It consists of a receptor binding domain which recognizes the ACE2 receptor present in the lungs, heart, kidney etc. It has a 20% more binding capability to SARS which can be why it spreads easily among us. Many nanomaterials have been developed, let it be polymers to nanoparticles, oligomers and liposomes. But the clinical transition is inhibited by the fact that when diluted, these compounds lose efficiency as the virus-compound complex dissociates leaving the viruses to resume their replication cycle. Recently, there has been a research where this problem was overcome by synthesizing nano particles that after binding are able to inhibit viral infectivity by damaging the virion by refueling it with broad spectrum antiviral drugs. This would help in blocking the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor. But this is hesitant to be done as receiving these drugs for a prolonged period can be dangerous and the infected person will be more weakened. Scientists are trying to fix this problem in a way that won‚Äôt hurt the patients.\xa0', 'Currently, for diagnosis, the technique used to detect covid-19 is using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which detects RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and provides accurate results. However, the disadvantage to this sophisticated equipment is the need of a laboratory with biosafety of level 2 or above. Other than this it also takes upto 3 days to acquire the results. This is a time-consuming method and extremely a disadvantage to public health emergencies. Various other testing kits have also been developed but they were found to be inaccurate. This is where nanotechnology can help us to provide solutions. For example, nano diagnostics depend on binding between nanoparticles and the interested target molecules to produce a signal which allow the detection of biomarkers or pathogens. This allows the use of smaller devices and a platform to make use of nanoscale properties available from interactions between the surface and biomolecules. The main advantage of using nano diagnosis is that the device used would be small (hand held), stable and highly accurate which would be easy for rapid testing.\xa0', 'We can say that nanotechnology has much to offer in the fight against covid-19 and has been very successful in treating various other diseases in the past by its advanced combating tool in drug designing as well as in drug targeting and better virus inhibition. Even if we do not feel like it now, we can say there will be a better tomorrow.']"

This post was peppered with fear and, more damaging, misinformation, which is causing anxiety, confusion, and vaccine hesitancy in the community.', 'It‚Äôs clear the author doesn‚Äôt have a good grasp on the science. The author calls himself a ‚Äúnatural health nerd‚Äù blogger. From what I can find, he is not an epidemiologist, not a healthcare provider, not public health specialist, not an immunologist, and not anything that qualifies him to speak accurately on this topic.So, I thought I would set the record straight‚Ä¶', '1. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ""VACCINE MAKERS ARE IMMUNE FROM LIABILITY', '""This is true. Vaccine sponsors (like Pfizer or Moderna) are immune from liability in the United States. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you are out of luck in the small, small chance that something might happen. We have systems in place for this, like the Department of Health and Human Services\' Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) or the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP; but this doesn‚Äôt cover FDA emergency authorizations). A great place for more information about all here.', '2. \xa0 \xa0 ""THE CHECKERED PAST OF THE VACCINE COMPANIES""', 'I guess this is true. But most companies have a checkered past. But we have checks and balances for this in our vaccination system. For example, this is why we have a separate data and safety monitoring board (called DSMB) for every study (not just vaccines), or an external committee of scientists for the FDA (like here) or an external committee of scientists for the CDC (called the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices- you can go here for more info) . And we have seen during this pandemic that those checks and balances WORK! See here as an example.', '3. ""THE UGLY HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO MAKE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES""', 'What? There is no ugly history. It‚Äôs actually amazing to hear about the amount of innovation, and genius, and hard work that has gone behind making these vaccines. The work started in 2003. You can read about why this vaccine was NOT rushed here.', '#4: ""THE ""DATA GAPS"" SUBMITTED TO THE FDA BY THE VACCINE MAKERS""', 'He specifically called out these groups. His argument is sometimes true but sometimes not true for‚Ä¶', '1. Anyone younger than age 18: This is true for Moderna and J&J. This is not true for Pfizer (ages 16-18). The Pfizer adolescent trial is up for emergency authorization now (see data here). Moderna‚Äôs adolescent trial data should be coming in the next month or two.', '2. Anyone older than age 55: This is just plain false. We have lots of clinical trial data on this. In fact, the vaccines sometimes work BETTER among this group than younger populations.', '3. Pregnant or lactating mothers: This is true, pregnant or lactating mothers were not eligible to participate in the clinical trials. But we do have quite a bit of safety data on this group already (see here). And multiple professional organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have consistently stated that the benefits of a vaccine outweigh the risks', '.4. Auto-immune conditions: This is not true. There is data from the clinical trial. We just don‚Äôt have a lot, so people with these conditions need to consult with their healthcare providers.', '5. Immunocompromised individuals: Again not true. There is data in there. We just don‚Äôt have a lot, so people with these conditions need to consult with their healthcare providers.', '6. No data on transmission of covid: Moderna had data on this in their clinical trial. Pfizer and J&J did not. But we have it now (see here).', '7. No data on preventing mortality from covid: This is false. This was the whole point of the clinical trials‚Ä¶? And no one died from the vaccine.', '8. No data on duration of protection from covid. This is false. We have up to 6 months now. But that‚Äôs because we only have 6 months worth of data. From our understanding of COVID19 cousins, we think this protection lasts 1-2 years. We also understand the science behind these vaccines very well and are not worried about long term effects (see more here)', '#5: ""NO ACCESS TO THE RAW DATA FROM THE TRIALS""', 'Depends how you define raw data. There are 180 pages of data in the FDA documents, which you can find here (J&J), here (Moderna), or here (Pfizer). If you want the line by line data (what us epidemiologists would call raw data) you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ this is not available. But, this is rarely publicly available for any study. Also, you‚Äôre not an epidemiologist or scientist, so what would you do with this raw data if you can‚Äôt analyze it correctly?', '#6: ""NO LONG-TERM SAFETY TESTING""', 'This is true. But we have no reason to think this would be a problem from what we know from the science. This biotechnology has been in development for decades. See why we aren‚Äôt necessarily worried here.', '#7: ""NO INFORMED CONSENT""', 'This is just plain false. If you are in an RCT (or any research study at that) you have to read a 15-page informed consent document. You are usually walked through this document too and are clearly asked if you have questions. THEN you have to sign up. This is an informed consent. Plain and simple. Just ask any of the more than 200,000 Americans in COVID19 vaccine trials right now.', '#8: ""UNDER-REPORTING OF ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DEATH""', 'There has never been another drug, in the history of drugs, that the CDC has been more transparent about adverse side effects and death investigations than these COVID19 drugs. It‚Äôs absolutely fantastic how much they‚Äôre monitoring and sharing on a regular basis. And I‚Äôve been updating you all on these meetings, in which they provide this data. If you aren‚Äôt convinced, search my blog. I‚Äôve talked about this safety data way too much to list all the posts. You can start here or here or here.', '#9: ""THE VACCINES DO NOT STOP TRANSMISSION OR INFECTION""', 'This is just plain wrong. Yes vaccines stop transmission. We have over 10 studies that show this now. The question, now, is how MUCH does it stop transmission? We are seeing anywhere between 70-95%. I‚Äôve also been updating on a regular basis, and you can see the numbers in my latest vaccine table', '.#10: PEOPLE ARE CATCHING COVID AFTER BEING FULLY VACCINATED', 'This is correct. Vaccines take a while to work (2 weeks after the second dose). So, yes you can get COVID19 during that time because you‚Äôre not protected from the vaccine yet', '.#11: THE OVERALL DEATH RATE FROM COVID', 'First off, this is NOT true for specific populations. If you‚Äôre going to spread this stat, please at least get the number right. Second, death isn‚Äôt the only outcome. Period. There isn‚Äôt one body system that COVID19 hasn‚Äôt left a mark. Third, if this WAS true (which it isn‚Äôt), 1% of 330,000,000 is a lot of death. See here for more details about this very argument.', '#12: THE BLOATED COVID DEATH NUMBERS', 'It‚Äôs just not true. I wish we had more faith in our medical doctors and medical examiners to classify death. Just look at the excess death numbers. COVID19 is the third leading cause of death in the United States. See here for a whole post about it.', '#13: FAUCI AND SIX OTHERS AT NIAID OWN PATENTS IN THE MODERNA VACCINE', 'Okay? Why does this matter? None of these people are on the independent safety review board for safety and data integrity for the vaccines.', '#14: FAUCI IS ON THE HOT SEAT FOR ILLEGAL GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH', 'Again, doesn‚Äôt matter. Stop targeting this man', '.#15: THE VIRUS CONTINUES TO MUTATE', 'Yes‚Ä¶but the vaccines continue to work. Vaccines are the only thing protecting us right now against variants', '.#16: CENSORSHIP...AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF SCIENTIFIC DEBATE', 'Absence of scientific debate? This guy needs to get outside of his echo chamber. There has been nothing but scientific debate during the entire pandemic.

Protection weans especially for the milder or asymptomatic cases. Also, we have seen very recently that the antibody response is stronger for those with vaccines (when compared to ‚Äúnatural‚Äù infection). \xa0', 'That‚Äôs it.

In late 2019, it had spread exponentially and was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by World Health Organization. Modern quarantine measures, such as lockdowns, curfews, banning community gatherings, cancellation of scheduled social and public activities, closure of mass transit networks, and other travel restrictions, have been implemented internationally to halt the spread of the COVID19 virus. These have impacted the majority (if not all) of the world‚Äôs population, dramatically altering what was previously considered normal and complicating aspects of everyday life that were previously easy and uncomplicated. Many people‚Äôs daily life has been drastically altered, and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ways of life as we know them have been suspended indefinitely as well.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has posed catastrophic threat to human civilization in terms of health, environment, and lifestyle.  The primary impact of the virus is on human health, including direct respiratory system injury, compromise the immune system, aggravation of underlying medical conditions, and ultimately systemic failure and death. Furthermore, as quarantine or isolation has been imposed that involves separation from friends and family, as well as a change from normal daily routines, it jeopardizes the social, mental, and spiritual health of individuals.', 'When the virus spreads, so does the risk of misinformation and false evidence, which the WHO refers to as an ""infodemic."" The internet has become a common resource for learning about health and researching one\'s own health condition before claiming, ""I am healthy!"" without testing its legitimacy. So, what does health mean to you? Considering our current normal environment., does your own view of health changes? Are you one of those individuals who share fake news to scare? How and why should you avoid doing it? Do you keep yourself informed? Why do you think it is relevant to be informed and learn our current health status in this time?', 'Health is dynamic and ever-changing. Each person has their subjective definition of health. However, traditionally health has been defined in terms of the presence or absence of disease. As for the World Health Organization (WHO), ‚ÄúHealth is a state of complete physical, mental, and social, and spiritual well-being and not merely the absence of disease.‚Äù The four dimensions of health are physical, mental, social, and spiritual.', 'In this new normal setting, stereotyping health would be, not being infected by the virus. Being negative with the virus could mean that an individual has strong innate immunity with a good diet and healthy lifestyle thus enable them to perform daily living activities. We can then conclude that an individual is healthy. Nonetheless, health is more than just biological elements or social role performance and absence of the virus; it is a complex balance with the world setting and the ‚Äúability to live physically, emotionally, and socially.‚Äù', 'Health in the new normal setting is linked to governmental regulations. COVID-19 is a public health crisis that has imposed steep obstacles. The pandemic response poses significant challenges for the physical and mental health and social wellbeing, which are essential cornerstones of overall health. These measures have disproportionately impacted the marginalized and disadvantaged populations-especially those living in poverty, working in the informal economy, or lacking stable housing-threatening sustained access to the essential determinant of health.', 'Orders to ‚Äústay at home‚Äù impoverish societies by limiting public life keeping individuals out of it. The general populations freedom to move freely has been limited. The social isolation associated with the new normal setting has been shown to have a negative impact on a variety of mental health indicators. Loneliness, for instance, causes mood swings, depression, and an increase in overall mortality. Health necessitates more than disease eradication; it must be described and interpreted holistically since health is a human right that must be rendered clear.', 'However, although the negative outcome of this new normal setting is immense, we can also say that health is much like the yin and yang concept. Whereas yin represents darkness and positivity, and yang presents light and activity like improved hygiene. These concepts are necessary to maintain life‚Äôs balance and harmony. Health is greatly influenced by personal feelings‚Äîenergy, comfort, and the ability to perform. Also, health is personal but an elastic concept and must not be compared to a species-wide baseline, but a personal phenomenological baseline. If an individual has the capacity to adapt well and maintain balance, stress and resultant disease, or limitation of action including social capacity are minimized.', ""In a new normal environment, health can also be defined as instrumental. The idea of health as an instrument is a different way of describing a contribution to society, both individually and collectively. In short, we are talking about how an individual's behavior and decisions that can affect improvements in health status. My ‚Äòbeing healthy and keeping my family healthy is an instrument for preventing the spread of this disease in the population. Coronavirus does not only affect the elderly and others who are medically vulnerable. We are aware that it has the potential to impact and us. As a result, it is also our mutual duty to prevent the virus from spreading from person to person."", ""At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, health officials provided alerts and recommendations via various channels such as television and infographics on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This was often accompanied by the implementation of safety parameters on people's movement, which led in some degree of success in combating the virus. Some preventive measures, such as social isolation, regular hand washing, wearing face masks, and avoiding close contact with sick people or suspected Covid-19 cases, reduce the risk of infection with COVID-19. However, putting these steps into effect regularly is a major challenge."", 'Some people may claimed they were at low to no risk because they underestimated the severity of the issue. ', ""Therefore, improving people's habits necessitates motivating people to incorporate preventive behaviors in their everyday lives by supplying them with a clear rationale. The health education and information should be structured in a way that is understandable to the public and can connect with their own experience, but it should also be timely, factual, and acceptable to the relevant subgroups in the population."", 'At this time of the global pandemic, all of us can be a health educator. It is critical to remain an advocate for those in the society that are especially vulnerable‚Äîthose who are facing this pandemic with all the anxiety and uncertainty that comes with it‚Äîin the context of existing mental health and related social challenges in this new normal setting. However, let us all be responsible and fight misinformation. Let us help and guide each other to pave a new path forward to the return of day amidst differences of behaviors, habits, and perspective.']"

And so they tried to trace the origin and it turns out that 27 of the first 41 corona patients had gone to a wet market in Wuhan. As soon as they got the notice, they quickly shut down the place as they‚Äôve seen the same thing happen at a very similar situation.The SARS virus, 2004.It was originated in a wet market in southern China. Since most viruses come from animals and a wet market is a place where live animals are slaughtered and sold for consumption, a wet market is a pretty suitable place for viruses to run about. In these markets, the animals are stacked upon each other which results in the animals at the bottom receiving blood, excretion and pus from the animals at the top on an alarmingly large scale. But wet markets are all over the world. Why China?', 'The covid 19 is said to pass from a bat to a pangolin and THEN to humans. It‚Äôs extremely rare for a virus to go through two different hosts and then reach humans. This means that the bats AND the pangolins would have to encounter each other in a way that virus will be passed. This is where China‚Äôs wet markets come into the spotlight. China is obviously known for its wide variety of animals slaughtered for consumption like snakes bats peacocks and even endangered species like tigers. Wildlife farming was permitted decades ago to support the economically weaker sections of China when a huge famine broke out. But when the communist regime of chine foresaw the booming economic potential of wildlife farming, they declared it as an important part of chinas income. This means that more animals will be captivated and put in such devastating locations. This also means more viruses are bound to being introduced and spread.', 'During the SARS outbreak, the Chinese regime had put a temporary ban on wildlife farming. But it was lifted right after the outbreak was brought under control. For covid19, the government has yet again placed a temporary ban. Many social media debates urge the government to make the ban permanent for good this time. Otherwise, outbreaks like these are bound to take place again.']"

The first thing that came to mind, was how COVID-19 came in and interrupted our lives. Due to COVID-19, so many schools were shutdown, and students were forced to learn online. It was stated that over 1.2 billion children were out of the classroom! Online learning had some conflicts of interest. Some thought that this way of learning was a success and others thought differently. Some people felt that the rapid move to online learning, without proper training, resulted in poor user experiences. Others felt that a new hybrid model of education will emerge with great benefits. Most students were sent home with laptops and iPad to continue their schoolwork at home. The issue here was that not all students had reliable internet to complete day to day activities. The impact that COVID-19 had on education were talked about all over the world, not only through blogs, but also through radio podcast. Teachers were being interviewed about how they were impacted during COVID. In the article, ‚ÄúThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed education forever.

I never believe anything I read online unless I have first researched it from a credible site.

Anytime I hear news, I hear it first from social media sites, which is why I always have to research what I am reading. Reading news online and in the newspaper is completely different. Most of the time the online source is not credible, due to so many fake sites giving false information.

We automatically knew to trust what was in the newspaper, but now we love entertainment and that is why we lean more toward technology than old media. We do not want to read or view anything that does not capture our attention. We live for the entertainment that technology brings us. The newspaper could never give us this type of entertainment.

In a short span of time, this infection has led to a global pandemic and has become a significant threat to the existence of present human society. Currently, there are no treatments for this infection and the measures established across various countries such as social distancing, usage of mask to prevent entry of the virus into the respiratory tract, quarantine, and containment together have reduced the prevalence of this disease and mortality in highly susceptible individuals. Here, we examine the structure, replication cycle, phylogeny and genomic organization of this virus and discuss the role of spike (S) protein of the virus, an important structure that interacts with the host ACE2 receptor facilitating viral entry. Further, we explore the epidemiology, symptoms of the disease, describe the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that establishes the diagnosis of the disease and also review its unique diagnostic features in the chest CT-Scan.

While there he hit me with the news that Ham‚Äôs sister, Preeya, has died (last Friday 14th August) from Covid 19. To say i was gobsmacked is an understatement. She was 49. The family could only talk to her over a loud speaker and had to say good bye that way as her life support was swithced off. Fucking hell, it‚Äôs terrible. And, what makes it worse, is how complacent I have become about the disease while it‚Äôs causing so much tragedy. As I said to Foggy, it‚Äôs important to renew our efforts in combatting this disease so that Preeya‚Äôs death at least means we learn. I also feel guilty for not realising that many people have passed like this - just because I (sort of) knew Preeya doesn‚Äôt mean I shouldn‚Äôt feel any less sorry for the dozens of people dying and many more affected everyday.

Her father, the Duke of York, was the second son of the King. Her mother, the Duchess of York was the youngest daughter of üè¥\U000e0067\U000e0062\U000e0073\U000e0063\U000e0074\U000e007f Scottish aristocrat the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. I think it is essential here to note that the ‚ÄòYork‚Äô title. Prince Andrew is the current Duke of York and one cannot help but feel the pain, for HMTQ. I will not say anymore about that but we know our royal family has been attacked and that is just added pain inflicted for her Majesty which I had not put together until now. She was delivered by Caesarean section surgery,  at her maternal grandfather‚Äôs house in Mayfair(London). The exact address being 17 Bruton Street, in Mayfair. She was  baptized by the Anglican Archbishop of York, as her father was the Duke of York.  The Archbishop was Cosmo Gordon Lang. It took place in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on the 29th of May, 1926. She was given the name Elizabeth Alexandra Mary. The Elizabeth was after her mother,  the name Alexandra was named after George V‚Äôs mother who had passed six months prior and the name Mary was after her paternal grandmother. She has the sweet nickname  ‚ÄúLilibet"" by her close family,based on what she called herself. She was cherished by her grandfather George V, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his health.', 'Princess Margaret üçº was born in 1930, and was her only sibling. As was custom at that time, the two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and Governess Marion Crawford. Varieties of their studies were concentrated on history, language, literature, and music. A major breach of trust occurred when the Governess went public, yes even then they had this sort of trust breaking. She published a ‚Äòtell all‚Äô as it would be called today. The book all about the girls was entitled The Little Princesses published in 1950. This resulted in a great deal of upset. I wonder if they had NDA‚Äôs back then? In the book while describing Princess Elizabeth mentions her love of horses, dogs, her organization, being a very responsible young woman and that fits very well with how we know her Majesty to be now doesn‚Äôt it? Sir Winston Churchill commented, when she was two years old that she was ‚Äúa character and she has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.‚Äú', 'During her grandfather‚Äôs reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the throne behind her uncle Edward and her father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own, who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession.  When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, The whole Wallace Simpson fiasco occurred which resulted in Edward eventually abdicating the throne and her father becoming King. Thusly, she became the heir apparent!', 'If you have not seen the movie the king speech I think it‚Äôs essential that you do. He struggled valiantly with a speech impediment and stuttering and a marked lack of confidence and bless the Queen mum,  she found someone to help him to get over this and to work through it. What came out of that was the horrendous abuse that he had suffered at the hands of his governesses who were  meant to protect him but who were very abusive. You must see that movie.', 'If her parents had had a later son, he would have been heir apparent. and above her in the line of succession, which was determined by male primogeniture. ', 'Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Vice Provost from Eton College. She learned French from a succession of French governesses. A Girl Guide she was too!! A company, entitled the 1st Buckingham Palace Company was formed! specifically so she could socialise with girls her own age.

However the queen mother absolutely refused that just like she refused to leave her husband and refused to leave the city she felt it was important that they remain there to be there for their people. as the queen mother famously said ‚ÄúThe children won‚Äôt go without me. I won‚Äôt leave without the King. And the King will never leave.‚Äù The princesses Stayed at Balmoral Castle in Scotland until the Christmas in the year of 1939 when they moved to Sandringham House in Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle where they lived for most of the next five years.At Windsor, the princesses, Per English tradition, staged pantos at Christmas in aid of the Queen‚Äôs Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC children‚Äôs hour addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.She stated: ‚ÄúWe are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers, and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.‚Äù I know I‚Äôve heard that a number of times and I can still hear her young voice saying those words.', 'In 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so she could act as one of five Counsellors of the State in the event of her father‚Äôs incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in Auxiliary Territorial Service. with the number of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander (female equivalent of Captain at the time) five months later. We all love seeing the pictures of her in uniform and her working on the jeep engine,  just amazing ! totally amazing young woman! I think it was just a mere foreshadowing of what the future held for her.', 'May 8, 1945 was VE day and the royal family along with the Prime Minister Winston Churchill on the balcony of Buckingham palace as the maybe millions of citizens were in the streets just celebrating the end of the war. Both Elizabeth and Margaret snuck out into the crowds and were anonymously celebrating amongst all the citizens and she later said they had asked their parents but they were still terrified of being recognized amongst the crowd. Before they knew it, they were swept along with a bunch of people cheering and dancing and going down the street in joy, just pure joy marvellous that she had that opportunity , the both of them did just marvellous!', 'The engagement üíç ', 'She met prince Philip in 1934 and then again in 1937. He was known then as Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark.  There actually is a family connection between the two of them, they are second cousins once removed, through a king in Denmark and also third cousins through ,who else,  her Majesty Queen Victoria!  They met again at the Royal Navy college in Dartmouth in July 20, 1939. Princess Elizabeth was only 13 years old at the time but she said she had fallen in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters. During the course of writing these letters Philip declared his love for her. Prince Philip was born June 10, 1921.  So if I do the math correctly he was 18 and she was 13 when she fell in love  with him. Oh my oh young love. She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947. ', 'Nothing is ever simple in this life and their engagement was certainly not without a controversy. Philip had no financial standing, Was foreign born the British subject with served in the Navy, and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. There was a lot of chatter amongst the aristocracy probably the most regular folks to have about that he wasn‚Äôt good enough for her and he was just kind of love a suave kind of guy. Well no one‚Äôs gonna argue that he wasn‚Äôt an absolutely handsome man and put that together with a navy uniform and a 13-year-old girls hormones boom you got love right there! No joke! Even back then the British papers were ruthless and I think he was dragged through whatever else everyone else has been dragged through since, Diana, and Catherine Sophie etc. Later biographies reported Elizabeth‚Äôs mother had reservations about the union initially, and teased Philip as ‚ÄúThe Hun‚Äù. In later life, however, the Queen Mother told a biographer that Philip was ‚Äúan English gentleman‚Äù. Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted to the Anglican and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, He took The surname of his mothers British family.Just before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style His Royal Highness.', 'The courtship üñä üìù üö¢ ', 'A diary made reference to the future marriage of Elizabeth and Philip was made as early as 1941, ‚ÄúHe is to be our Prince Consort, and that is why he is serving in our Navy.‚Äù The couple became secretly engaged in 1946, when Philip asked King George VI for his daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage. The King granted his request providing any formal engagement was delayed until Elizabeth‚Äôs 21st birthday the following April. Their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.Philip proposed to Elizabeth with a 3-carat round diamond ring consisting of ‚Äúa centre stone flanked by 10 smaller pave diamonds.‚Äù The diamonds were taken from a tiara that belonged to Philip‚Äôs mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg and were also used to create a quatrefoil bracelet for Elizabeth. According to Philip Eade, the author of Young Prince Philip: His Turbulent Early life, the young man wrote: ‚ÄúTo have been spared in the war and seen victory, to have been given the chance to rest and to re-adjust myself, to have fallen in love completely and unreservedly, makes all one‚Äôs personal and even the world‚Äôs troubles seem small‚Äù Prince Philip designed the square-cut diamond engagement ring with jewellers Philip Antrobus Ltd.The ring is a platinum ring set with eleven diamonds, a 3 carat round solitaire and five smaller stones set on each shoulder. Even though Prince Philip was born a Greek prince, his family were not extremely wealthy. His then-girlfriend was heir to the British throne, so using these diamonds may have been a way to save money as well as a sentimental gesture. According to current money, the ring is likely to be worth around ¬£207,082.', 'The wedding üë∞üèΩ ü§µ ü•Ç ', 'Oh what a glorious day!

When she toured Canada and visited President Harry S. Truman in Washington, D.C., in October 1951, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour. In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of Kenya. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of the King and consequently Elizabeth‚Äôs immediate accession to the throne. Philip broke the news to the new queen. Martin Charteris asked her to choose a regnal name; she chose to remain Elizabeth, ""of course‚Äù. She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom. She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into Buckingham Palace.', 'With Elizabeth‚Äôs accession, it seemed probable the royal house would bear the Duke of Edinburgh‚Äôs name, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband‚Äôs surname on marriage. The Duke‚Äôs uncle, Lord Mountbatten, advocated the name House of Mountbatten. Philip suggested House of Edinburgh, after his ducal title.The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth‚Äôs grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, ‚ÄúI am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.""In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsorwas adopted for Philip and Elizabeth‚Äôs male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.', 'Amid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorc√©‚Äö 16 years Margaret‚Äôs senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Charteris, ""the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought‚Äîshe hoped‚Äîgiven time, the affair would peter out.""Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession. Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.', 'Despite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March, the coronation on 2 June 1953 went ahead as planned, as Mary had asked before she died. The ceremony in Westminster Abbey, with the exception of the anointing and communion, was televised for the first time. Elizabeth‚Äôs coronation gown was embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries:English Tudor rose; Scots thistle; Welsh leek; Irish shamrock; Australian wattle; Canadian maple leaf; New Zealand silver fern; South African protea; lotus flowers for India and Ceylon; and Pakistan‚Äôs wheat, cotton, and jute.', 'The coronation of Elizabeth II took place on 2 June 1953 at Westminster Abbey, London.She acceded to the throne at the age of 25 upon the death of her father, George VI, on 6 February 1952, being proclaimed queen by her privy and executive councils shortly afterwards. The coronation was held more than one year later because of the tradition of allowing an appropriate length of time to pass after a monarch dies before holding such festivals. It also gave the planning committees adequate time to make preparations for the ceremony. During the service, Elizabeth took an oath, was anointed with holy oil, invested with robes and regalia, and crowned Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).', 'Celebrations took place across the Commonwealth realms and a commemorative medal was issued. It was the first British coronation to be fully televised; television cameras had not been allowed inside the abbey during her father‚Äôs coronation in 1937. Elizabeth‚Äôs was the fourth and last British coronation of the 20th century. It was estimated to have cost ¬£1.57 million (c. ¬£43,427,400 in 2019).', 'The dalliances of Philip ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶üò≥üò§ü§≠ü§´ü§îü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠', 'There is extensive information online about this and it‚Äôs very easy to find.

That  moral code is calling me right now and I I just, I cannot, l will not do this clue. ', 'Her stoicism‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ü§îüôèüèª', 'Queen Elizabeth has been a steady, stoic leader for some 63 years, making her the longest-reigning monarch in British history. There must have been vulnerabilities , a young bride, children, the loss of her beloved father, which all were warranted considering she ascended the throne at 25, as she was already navigating two new roles as wife and mother. And while, in this ominous stage of life, HMTQ struggled to strike a power balance with the far elder, far more experienced prime minister Winston Churchill, she similarly, according to the series, clashed with her husband. Philip quickly found himself forfeiting his naval career to support his wife‚Äîan uncomfortably advanced spousal dynamic, especially for a headstrong officer in the 1950s.', 'If having to walk several paces behind his bride was not emasculating enough, HMTQ also rejected his request to give their children his surname on advice from Churchill. ‚ÄúI am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,‚Äù Philip said, according to a biography of Elizabeth by Sally Bedell Smith, I‚Äôm nothing but a bloody amoeba.‚ÄùHMTQ did her best to give Philip responsibilities‚Äîmaking him the chairman of her coronation committee, for instance. But at every turn, Philip is regularly reminded of his unique limitations. However he was integral in absolutely insisting that the entire coronation be televised. At that time that was absolutely groundbreaking. We take it for granted now that royal weddings and events are televised but at that time nothing like that has ever happened before. And we have Prince Philip to thank for that because he fought for that literally. She also convinced governing bodies to let Philip learn to fly, but only after he agreed to take some risk-minimizing measures.', 'She has dealt with I believe 12 Prime Ministers, second world war, various terrorists issues, the Falkland Islands war, A man breaking into her bedroom at night, A man attempting to kidnap her daughter, family issues, the divorce of three of her children and the most difficult in terms of the public is when Diana was killed. They were up at Balmoral with the boys when this accident happened and they felt that was the best thing is to keep the boys away,  from far from the madding crowd so to speak, but the public drumbeat louder and louder and louder and Prime Minister at the time Tony Blair insisted that she makes some sort of statement or something because the people were very upset. Well now we know what ended up happening they came outside to see first of all their flowers at Balmoral and they went out to look at them with the boys. Then they came back to London and they all, her Majesty, Prince Philip and the boys went out to look at the flowers and in front of the palace Buckingham palace. Do you remember all the flowers in front of Kensington Palace?? It was unbelievable. And the ultimate stoicism is her when she nodded as Diana‚Äôs coffin rode by her, that was unprecedented for a reigning monarch bow their head to anybody. We‚Äôve seen subsequently so many things. I think the last four years with Madam in the picture I know she talked about the annus horribilis with the divorce is years ago, but there‚Äôs nothing like what‚Äôs been happening like the attack on the monarchy in the last four years!  Keep calm and carry-on, she‚Äôs done that every single day! One would never know she was under any stress,  she always looks beautiful , she‚Äôs well put together! One never would know that she had a sleepless night.

What the Queen was like as a mum to their children.The Queen treated Prince Charles and Prince Edward very differently.HMTQ became a mother more than 70 years ago, when she welcomed her first son Prince Charles in 1948. Prince Charlesüçºüçºüçºüçºüçºüçº', 'Charles, Prince of Wales, was born Charles Philip Arthur George on November 14, 1948. Charles was born in Buckingham Palace. According to biographer Sally Bedell Smith, while Elizabeth was ""delighted‚Äù by her first baby, she was often absent when Charles was an infant, instead traveling to be with Prince Philip in Malta where he‚Äôd been posted for Royal Navy duty. Smith claims ‚ÄúPrince Philip scarcely knew his son for the first two years of the boy‚Äôs life, though on his return from overseas duty he did take the time to teach Charles to shoot and fish, and to swim in the Buckingham Palace pool.""Prince Charles was four years old at the time of his mother‚Äôs 1953 coronation, and her royal commitments, including a six month Commonwealth tour, took her and Philip around the globe while Charles and his sister stayed at home with their caretakers. Historian Robert Lacy, who has served as an advisor for the Queen ‚Äúhad been brought up in that style herself, after all, with her parents leaving her at home and entrusting her entire schooling to a governess and home tutors.‚Äù Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir apparent to the English throne in British history. When asked by a journalist when he first realized he was meant to be king one day, Charles said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs something that dawns on you with the most ghastly inexorable sense. I didn‚Äôt wake up in my pram and say: ‚ÄòYippie, I‚Ä¶‚Äô But I think it just dawns on you slowly that people are interested in one, and slowly you get the idea that you have a certain duty and responsibility.""üçºüçºüçºüçºüçºüçºPrincess Anne, Elizabeth‚Äôs only daughter Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise was born on August 15, 1950, at London royal residence Clarence House where Elizabeth and Philip lived until 1953. She currently holds the title of Anne, Princess Royal, and at the time of her birth she was second in line for the throne after Charles. Since then, subsequent royal births have moved Anne to fourteenth in the line of succession.', 'Anne was a tot when her mother and father began leaving her and Charles at home for royal obligations, often for extended amounts of time. But she‚Äôs publicly dismissed any narrative that paints Queen Elizabeth as emotionally distant.', '""We as children may have not been too demanding in the sense that we understand what the limitations were in time and the responsibilities placed on her as monarch in the things she had to do and the travels she had to make,‚Äù Anne told the BBC in 2002. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt believe any of us for a second thought she didn‚Äôt care for us in exactly the same way as any other mother did.""Like every British royal, Princess Anne‚Äôs public image is largely formed by how the U.K. media infers her every move. In Anne‚Äôs case, certain members of the press gave her the (very harsh) nickname Her Royal Rudeness, though accounts of her supposedly rude behavior suggest a possibly sexist discomfort with her forthright manner. She explained her longtime dislike for the custom of royal walkabouts. ""I mean it gets easier but, can you imagine? I mean how many people enjoy walking into a room full of people that you‚Äôve never met before?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd then try a street. I don‚Äôt think many youngsters would actually volunteer to do that.‚Äù', 'Anne‚Äôs reputation as a gutsy, no-nonsense lady was bolstered by her reaction to a failed kidnapping attempt against the princess in 1974. At his demand for a hefty ransom, she reportedly responded, ‚ÄúNot bloody likely.""Princess Anne, like her brother Charles, has been married twice. She married Captain Mark Phillips in 1973, with whom she shares children Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall. Shortly after their 1992 divorce, she remarried to Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence, her current husband.', 'üçºüçºüçºüçºüçºPrince Andrew.Elizabeth didn‚Äôt have another child for an entire decade after welcoming Princess Anne (being the Queen of England is a pretty time-consuming gig). Her Majesty gave birth to Andrew Albert Christian Edward‚Äîor as we know him, Prince Andrew, Duke of York‚Äîat Buckingham Palace on February 19, 1960. He is currently eighth in line to the throne and the first baby born to a reigning British sovereign in 103 years was cause for a lot of excitement. While custom and circumstance kept the Queen away from her first two kids in their early years, the queen took upwards of 18 months to ""produce and enjoy‚Äù Andrew and Edward, biographer Lacy claimed. Home-schooled until age 8, after prep school he went on to Gordonstoun, the same Scotland boarding school his father and older brother both attended. Prince Andrew married Sarah ‚ÄúFergie‚Äù Ferguson in 1986, had daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, and divorced in 1996. However, Fergie reportedly still lives with Prince Andrew in the Royal Lodge in Berkshire, England, and she‚Äôs called them ""the happiest divorced couple in the world.‚ÄúPrince Andrew has more recently been at the center of another tabloid scandal: He‚Äôs accused of taking part in the sex trafficking ring of late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein‚Äîallegations both the prince and the Palace deny. The Prince‚Äôs denials, which he attempted to elaborate upon in a high-profile interview on BBC‚Äôs Newsnight, were followed by a November 20 announcement that the Duke of York will ""step back from public duties for the foreseeable future.‚Äù', 'üçºüçºüçºüçºüçºüçºPrince Edward, the Queen‚Äôs youngest child!Prince Edward Antony Richard Louis‚Äôs birth was a major break from tradition: He was the first of Elizabeth‚Äôs children to be born with Prince Philip in the delivery room. As the Independent notes, royal biographer Ingrid Seward wrote that ‚ÄúThe Duke of Edinburgh was actually holding his wife‚Äôs hand as their youngest was born on March 10, 1964.""The Queen, by then aged 37, had asked him to be there,‚Äù Seward claims in her book My Husband and I: The Inside Story Of 70 Years Of Royal Marriage. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd been keenly reading women‚Äôs magazines that stressed the importance of involving fathers in childbirth and had become fascinated by the idea. In 1968, when Edward was four, the royal family allowed a production crew into their home in an attempt to give viewers a look at how (supposedly) normal they actually were. The documentary‚Äîand the public‚Äôs mixed reaction. Edward has stayed out of the spotlight (and tabloid headlines) more than his brothers have, and the baby of the royal family is rumored to be the Queen and Prince Philip‚Äôs favorite child.

The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union. In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.', 'Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II and Commonwealth leaders met at the 1960 Commonwealth Conference.', 'The absence of a formal mechanism within the Conservative Party for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden‚Äôs resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to commission to form a government. Eden recommended she consult Lord Salisbury, the Lord President of the Council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.', 'The Suez crisis and the choice of Eden‚Äôs successor led, in 1957, to the first major personal criticism of the Queen.

Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, unilaterally declared independence while expressing ‚Äúloyalty and devotion‚Äù to Elizabeth. Although the Queen formally dismissed him, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.As Britain‚Äôs ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973.', 'During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall, London, on her horse, Burmese.

In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard.After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.', 'Elizabeth riding Burmese at the 1986 Trooping the Colour ceremony.

The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party‚ÄîThatcher‚Äôs political opponents.Thatcher‚Äôs biographer, John Campbell, claimed ‚Äúthe report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making‚Äù.Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen,and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift‚Äîmembership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter‚Äîto Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.   Brian Mulroney Canadian prime minister between 1984 and 1993, said Elizabeth was a ‚Äúbehind the scenes force‚Äù in ending apartheid.', 'By the end of the 1980s, the Queen had become the target of satire.The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show It‚Äôs a Royal Knockout in 1987 was ridiculed.In Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau.The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup.

The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny.In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with ‚Äúa touch of humour, gentleness and understanding‚Äù.Two days later, Prime Minister John Major announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list.In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.The year ended with a lawsuit, as the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast.

In the years to follow, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana‚Äôs marriage continued.Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings.Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen‚Äôs wider family rather than her own behaviour and actionsIn consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying a divorce was desirable.', 'In August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris.

Coal powered the railroads and ships that built the British empire. It helped the country survive two world wars, and at its height between those wars, coal mines employed 1.2 million people.  So this winter, when the UK announced its plan to stop burning coal for electricity by 2025, the shift was seismic.The announcement signaled the dethroning of King Coal in a country where it had reigned for more than a century, and where just six years prior it provided more than 40 percent of the nation‚Äôs energy.

I feel like Julia Roberts, in Runaway Bride, discovering what kind of eggs I like. By the way, I am still making that determination.

They were cremating bodies at a breakneck speed but did not address it or say anything about it. The majority cellphone company had a loss of hundreds of thousands of accounts. That‚Äôs huge because in China they use their phones for everything, they pay bills and buy things with their phones a lot more than America, Canada, etc. and due to the nature of the government there is only one major carrier to facility the ease of control. These cell accounts are tied into the social credit system that china has going-- it‚Äôs to replace normal credit scores-- which means it‚Äôs the same as thousands upon hundreds of thousands of social security numbers just vanishing without an explanation to the world at large. \n\nSo I think we all know what happened there but there‚Äôs more to it, I want to post this question:\n\nIt‚Äôs well known that China has concentration camps for Muslims that they essentially call reeducation camps. Conditions in said camps have been reported to be absolutely nightmarish and the population of Muslims in said camps have been reported to be close to and sometimes over 1 million. \n\nDoes anyone really believe China took any additional or precautionary steps to stop the spread of covid19 within these camps and help those that may have contracted the virus? I mean, of course, more than a bullet to the head. \n\nI ask this because I certainly do not think any additional measures of the sort were taken given that, as previously stated, thousands upon thousands of citizens with good enough social standing to still be free and have cell phones just disappeared. \n\nWell, no, they didn‚Äôt disappear... you know where they went? \n\nThey likely went to two places: \n\nThe atmosphere within that mysterious ‚Äúsmog‚Äù and wherever the government disposed of the remaining ashes.\n\nI sincerely hope I-- and thousands that think the same as me-- are wrong. I sincerely hope that the camps are not actually concentration camps. I sincerely hope with all of my being that the vulnerable individuals within those camps were looked after as if they were the same as any Chinese citizen in good standing with the government. I sincerely... WITH ALL OF MY HEART... hope that the satellites were wrong and that the smog was just some sort of dust cloud for some desert or just some sort of pollution that was not made up of people that had dreams... that had loved ones waiting for them to come home... that had fears that they faced by placing their complete trust in their government.\n\nDespite how badly I hope this is all just a misunderstanding... I know it‚Äôs not likely to be the case. \n\nI know everyone that might read this has no idea who I am nor will the majority care and that‚Äôs fine, but please...\n\nDon‚Äôt let the sum of their last moments amount to little more than a ‚Äúhmm, that‚Äôs weird‚Äù. \n\nDon‚Äôt forget about the millions that-- even though they know the truth and do not agree with their government/do not feel safe in their home country-- have no choice but to have hope. The alternative to not having hope is complete powerlessness and vulnerability that is beyond their means to even dream of correcting. \n\nDon‚Äôt forget Wuhan and the citizens that were dragged out of their homes before being forced at gun point into a van with a dozen or more strangers. Placed in a van so that even if you weren‚Äôt actually infected with Covid19 you would be sharing an-- at most-- enclosed space of 12‚Ä≤x6‚Ä≤ (and that‚Äôs being generous) with at least ONE person infected with the corona virus which would ensure that the odds of you remaining free of it dropped dramatically.\n\nThere‚Äôs a video of a healthcare worker in China just breaking down and screaming in what looks like the staff break room. Screaming and violently sobbing without words or control over herself in the least. This virus would not have been the first time she saw someone die but it would be the first scenario-- and likely the only scenario-- in her lifetime to show her that not only were people dying but they‚Äôd continue dying by the thousands no matter what she did. \n\nAs someone who is a paramedic let me just say... It hurt beyond anything I could imagine the first time someone looked me in the eyes and begged me to save them or asked me to reassure them that they would not die then regardless of how picture perfect and text book my interventions were I lost them. It hurt every time after that, but I can‚Äôt imagine having that experience dozens of times in a single day.\n\nLast thing then I swear I‚Äôm done...\n\nThose of my generation in America (I‚Äôm in my early 30‚Ä≤s) know how watching hundreds and hundreds die on live television can shape a young mind. Imagine being the age we were whilst this pandemic carves a swath out of the world‚Äôs populace. Imagine the fear of an unseen force that no one really completely understands in carriers that may not show any outward symptoms at all and said carriers recovering just fine but the five other people they exposed going on to die.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a parent check in on your children, make time to explain everything to them so that-- hopefully-- armed with knowledge they will be better equipped to deal wtih the fact that they‚Äôre being asked to go on as if it‚Äôs still everyday life. \n\nChildren? Check with your parents. They may be beyond stressed wondering how they need to protect you from what‚Äôs happening and wondering how you are mentally but not exactly sure how to ask as they fear they might make your stress WORSE in doing so. \n\nJust in general-- look out for one another, call or text your friends, family, and loved ones to check in on them.

280,rosiegeall,"['Back at the beginning of the year I wrote a paper for one of my courses where I talked about the inevitability of pandemics. And I would like to brag that did get 87% on this paper.', 'This was the title of the paper I wrote, the main subject of this was a type of vaccine which I‚Äôm not going to talk about, I might write a different post about it another time. Instead I‚Äôm going to talk about pandemics, specifically viral ones.', 'First I‚Äôll explain the title a bit, a zoonotic virus is a virus that has been spread to humans from an animal, this virus will have originally infected an animal, like a bat or a pig, then will mutate and change to have the ability to infect humans. Some notable examples of these would be swine flu (influenza virus that infected pigs), bird flu (influenza virus that infected birds) and Covid19 (coronavirus, specifically SARS-CoV-2, a virus that likely infected bats with a possible intermediate species).\xa0I‚Äôd also like to note the difference between Covid19 and SARS-CoV-2, Covid19 stands for coronavirus disease 2019, so is the disease which arose in 2019, whereas SARS-CoV-2 which stands for\xa0                 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2, it is the actual virus which causes the disease. This isn‚Äôt a particularly important difference for this post but I just wanted to explain because I‚Äôm a nerd who likes this sort of thing. A Pandemic is the spread of a new disease on a global scale, previous pandemics have been caused by zoonotic influenza viruses, the difference of this to epidemics is the scale, epidemics are much smaller. So when people say global pandemic they are basically saying a global spread of a disease on a global scale which irritates me slightly.', 'You might be wondering why I‚Äôve put an emphasis on zoonotic viruses, the reason for this is that they are much more likely to cause pandemics. This is because the population lacks immunity to the virus as they haven‚Äôt been exposed to it or a closely related virus and so it spread much more quickly and easily.', 'The\xa0risk of pandemics has increased with the increase of travel around the globe, the development of urban areas, natural environments being exploited and changes in land use. For the prevention of a pandemic,      strict infection control is used, when patients show symptoms of the disease, they are quarantined and then monitored in isolation. The disadvantage of this strategy of controlling the spread by isolation of those showing symptoms is that some viral diseases are infectious during their incubation period before symptoms appear. This shows the difficulty of containing many viral diseases due to their complexity and shows the need to quickly immunise individuals against epidemic causing diseases to stop the development of a pandemic.\xa0To immunise people vaccines which are very useful for protecting against the spread of diseases are used, however, to create, equip and commission a vaccine it takes on average 7 years, and manufacturing takes 0.5 - 3 years. This length of time it takes to get a vaccine is far too long to stop a pandemic as viruses can spread extremely quickly.\xa0', 'Vaccines against the flu (influenza viruses) is slightly different because we have a vaccine for it which just needs to be changed for each strain, for each seasonal vaccine different strains are selected to protect against which are likely to cause disease. But the process of selecting a strain to distributing the vaccine takes 6 months, and if a new strain emerges this might not be quick enough to stop the pandemic. This happened with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. So even though this process is much shorted, it is still not short enough', 'These measures are different than the ones we are currently seeing, such as lockdown, but that is because controlling a pandemic and preventing one are different.', 'There is more to it than i have said, as pandemic prevention is an incredibly complicated issue, but the main point I am trying to make is that a pandemic has been likely for many years we just needed the right virus for it to happen. There is so much research out there that proves that more effort needed to have gone into preventative measures as our pandemic risk was obviously high as we now see.', ""I hope i explained this alright and that I didn't ramble too much, if anyone wants the resources where i got the info or any questions feel free to ask x""]"

Suddenly we could no longer pop around to our friend‚Äôs houses for a quick cup of tea. We were encouraged to stick to our household bubbles, to wear face masks and to regularly sanitize our hands (World Health Organization, 2022).', 'But none of this could prepare us for the destruction that this virus was about to cause to many kiwi families (World Health Organization, 2022). ', 'I still remember exactly where I was on the day the NZ (New Zealand) Government made the announcement 2 years ago. I was living in a rural area at the time, sitting outside on the deck, soaking up the sun, looking out at the farmland and deep forests beyond. So quiet and peaceful, and with plenty of fresh air to breathe, it was exactly the sort of place you could relax and unwind. ', 'That was the day we found out we were going into lockdown. ', 'Stay within your bubbles and if you need to go outside for exercise, walk around your neighborhood. One person per household could go shopping and we all had to stand in line while a few people at a time were let into the store, as others came out. No more public gatherings and more social distancing (Covid19 Response, 2022). ', 'It was also the day that I had broken my phone and there were no stores open for me to buy a replacement. I bought a simple and cheap phone from the gas station, which turned out to be one of the worst purchases I ever made. Going through lockdown without a phone was not an option for me though because I wanted to stay connected to people. \xa0', 'Two years on since our first lockdown and the coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand is ongoing, just like in many other parts of the world (Donnell, 2022). Most of us are aware that the pandemic is ongoing, despite alert level systems, lockdowns, managed quarantines, isolations, and traffic light systems, which aimed to hold the virus now gone. Even though we do not all need to wear face masks or do social distancing anymore, covid is in fact still here. ', 'Take the influenza pandemic for example which started in 1918, a virus that was here 100 years ago, and is still around to this day in 2022. People are affected every year by the flu, but now we can manage the symptoms better and the death toll has significantly decreased. Covid-19 is the next influenza virus (Donnell, 2022). ', 'When Newstalk ZB host Heather du Plessis-Allan announced on the talk show (Donnell, 2022) that the pandemic was over, it could not have been more poorly timed, or perfectly timed as it could serve as a lesson about sensitivity and awareness. Despite lesser news reports and conversation about the virus, just because the restrictions and mandates had been lifted, does not mean we are taking a break from Covid-19. \xa0', 'On that same day, eight people had been announced dead with Covid-19 in New Zealand (Donnell, 2022). ', 'I think the issue there is that du Plessis-Allan didn‚Äôt choose her words carefully when describing the current pandemic status. I don‚Äôt believe she meant to dismiss all the tragedy and loss that so many New Zealand families have endured since the first case here in 2020.\xa0', 'I think she came from a place that we can all relate to about the restrictions and vaccination mandates that were placed on us for so long. Speaking about the frustrations we all experienced, for everyone nationwide who endured loss and adjusting to life with the pandemic. If the pandemic is here to stay, then we may as well get on with our lives with business as usual. \xa0', 'But she isn‚Äôt alone in feeling this way with Stuff news reporting that their audience was no longer interested in covid related news. National leader Christopher Luxon returned from an overseas trip and reported that covid conversations were not happening anymore (Donnell, 2022).\xa0', 'In New Zealand, our hospitals are in a crisis, struggling to accommodate patients in need of beds for recovery after surgery due to them being occupied by patients affected by covid (Donnell, 2022). This is truly alarming to me as we are still in the early stages of the pandemic, just two years after the first reported case in NZ. If this is happening now, what will happen in the future if we can‚Äôt resolve this? \xa0', 'New Zealand journalists can definitely have a bigger impact on what direction we should now take when dealing with covid content. When the pandemic first hit, the media flooded us with information about what we should do in a crisis. Now that we are aware the coronavirus is likely to be around for a longer period of time, the media should focus on how covid will continue to be an ongoing issue and deliver us the truth surrounding covid issues, as they have an obligation to serve the public‚Äôs best interest (Myllylahti, 2022). ', 'On the surface, the lack of covid representation in the media and public conversations does make it easier to feel like it‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs like the old saying ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù. The truth is that the virus is still here, fatally harming New Zealanders, even if there is now less media coverage and restrictions, we are not on a covid holiday. We shouldn‚Äôt go on about our lives like nothing is wrong, but even if we do it is not denial but wanting to regain a sense of normalcy again after our lives have changed dramatically. \xa0 ', 'So, what can our journalists do? Apply pressure to government to bring back traffic light or alert level systems, wearing masks in public and social distancing? Do we need to bring back lockdowns when cases begin to rise again? Masks were horrible to wear during the warmer months, but I think we do need to make sure our safety measures are in place to protect those who are more vulnerable than others. I‚Äôm not sure that going into lockdown again would be a good idea. \xa0', 'As someone who has medical conditions that can affect chances of getting covid (CDC, 2022) and living with an at-risk individual, we both have taken personal safety measures and I would support the idea of the traffic light system returning instead of the alert level system. I don‚Äôt agree with going into lockdown and I think businesses would suffer even more if they had to shut down again. The traffic light system allowed us to have more freedom, as well as access to essentials, although it does come at the cost of being vaccinated which many do not agree with. \xa0', 'I had my covid vaccinations done to protect myself and my family which is the most important reason to consider when deciding to get the vaccination. It‚Äôs a personal choice, some people might not live with their family or be around a person who is at risk, so the most important reason then would be if it was right for them. Some do not agree with having the vaccine and that is okay too. \xa0']"

Such cases may not require admission to COVID-19 blocks or dedicated COVID-19 hospitals.Hygiene being one of the most important factors today to deal with health and with Covid19, we need to understand the importance of Hygiene in everything i.e Hospitals, Homes, food, and the topmost important factor of keeping yourself hygienic.', 'PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)', 'Personal protective equipment is the special equipment that a person wears to create a barrier between you and germs. This barrier reduces the chance of touching, being exposed to, and spreading germs. It is necessary for all the health care workers and all the fighters fighting in the frontline to have this as a protection layer.', 'Child Help Foundation has performed multiple activities where they have guided the Frontline Workers on the knowledge of COVID19, how to avoid infections, distributed masks, gloves sanitizers, and PPEs to the needy.', 'Nutrition', 'Good nutrition is very important before, during, and after an infection. While no foods or dietary supplements can prevent COVID-19 infection, maintaining a healthy diet is an important part of supporting a strong immune system. A good and healthy diet is one of the main sources to keep a human body healthy. During this time poor nutrition in childhood is associated with both short-term and long-term adverse consequences such as poorer immune status, higher caries rates, and poorer cognitive function and learning ability. These problems arise primarily because parents do not have enough money to spend on food, not because money is being spent unwisely on different things.', 'During these tough times where the world fights against COVID19, Children living on the streets require the most attention concerning food and nutrients. They are exposed out in the open where they need proper dietary food to face the risk.The Child Help Foundation has been on the forefront to ensure food to the needy. Child Help Foundation, along with its Partner NGOs and Volunteers has catered to more than 3 Lakh Individuals with rations and basic medical supplies. During these difficult times, we all need to come together and fight as one for everyone against the risk which we all face.Kids living on the streets may not have all the privileges which becomes a more difficult war for them to survive this outbreak. .Malnutrition plays a vivid role in almost all the children on the streets. In India 44% of children under the age of 5 are underweight. 72% of infants have anemia.When food prices rise and supply chains break down, the wages of the poor and vulnerable fall substantially. All the daily wagers and the poor are struggling to fight for a living, first and then fighting against the virus. At such times, it is always the women and young children who are the hardest hit, especially children with deficiencies and low immune system. Notable management intervention is then needed to ward off undernutrition and poverty, which can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to the disease.Child Help Foundation workers, therefore, continue to distribute rations of rice, dal (pulses), wheat, and oil - to the needy and young children, to ensure that they receive their regular supply of nutrients during these critical periods of their life. Rations are being provided from door to door at the homes of the needy.Today, we have reached a place where we need to think of everyone as family and help them to survive. Doctors, Policemen, Medical staff, Corporation workers, daily wagers, kids, youngsters, and as Indians we all need to stay strong and support each one. It is a phase, it will pass, but it will become a little easier and less scary if we do it together.In the days to come, as the challenges of healthcare, food becomes too chaotic for Governments and too costly for NGOs to manage, the onus ultimately will fall on the Government. A good amount of infusion of funds is required to set things right so that we are prepared in advance to face such situation. Child Help Foundation is focussed on Medical Emergencies, Education, Water and Sanitation, Menstrual Hygiene, Gender Equality, Zero Hunger, and Calamity Relief.  ']"

Personal  protective equipment or PPE acts as a protective barrier against disease-causing  viruses, which are often secreted by the patients in the form of droplets while  they cough or sneeze. A coronavirus is a highly contagious disease that can even  be fatal, it is essential to wear proper protective clothing while caring for or  treating Covid19 patients. Virus protection clothing includes gloves, gowns,  facemasks, aprons, boots, eyewear, and so forth. So, does everyone need to wear  virus protection clothing, or should only healthcare workers wear  it?\n\nSignificance of wearing protective gear\n\nThe recent global  coronavirus pandemic has turned the entire world system topsy-turvy with its  highly contagious feature and death toll. Though it originated in a wet market  in , it spread to the entire world within a few months, infecting billions with  the exponential growth of death rate in several countries such as the USA,  Italy, Spain, Brazil, and Iran.\n\nThe novel coronavirus continues to spread  all across the countries in the world with health officials stepping up efforts  to contain the pandemic through various channels. As the virus is known to  spread through the droplets of the infected people, which include mucus and  saliva, it is important to wear protective clothing while you are in close  contact with them. This is precisely the reason doctors, nurses, and other  healthcare professionals need to wear PPE while treating or caring for a COVID  positive patient.\n\nAccording to medical research, the deadly virus can  stay suspended in the air for more than 10 minutes when an infected person  coughs or sneezes. It is also believed that an asymptomatic person can also be  contagious which is why it is necessary to wear facemasks and gloves when you  are in a public place.\n\nTo protect your loved ones and yourself from the  coronavirus, you need to follow the standard protocol of social distancing,  wearing protective facemasks, washing your hands frequently with soap and water,  using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, covering your face with a tissue or  sneezing into your elbow while you are at a public place. All these measures  will help to reduce the risk of transmission and slow down the progress of the  contagion. Though a complete lockdown or restricted movement can seldom halt the  spread of this contagious disease, it will slow down the process of mass  infection. It will also limit the amount of strain howo  rear bridge universal joint pin on the medical infrastructural facilities,  which are quite limited even in advanced countries.\n\nDue to the alarming  rise in coronavirus cases across the globe, there has been a substantial  shortage of virus protective clothing, which is extremely essential for  healthcare frontline workers.

In order to counteract the spread of COVID-19, a number of technical interventions have been implemented in addition to movement and interaction restrictions.', 'Many countries, including Australia, Singapore, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have deployed mobile phone applications to track individual contacts [6].

Fever is one of the oldest medical phenomena, characterized by an increase in core body temperature, and has been researched extensively for millennia [10].

The only way through this pandemic is together, if we all work together to learn and teach one another about the virus, abide by the protocol and restrictions, as well as provide support to those that are in need we can overcome this battle.', 'Personally one the main disadvantages of this pandemic to my life was the fact that I was prevented from doing my ‚Äúseva‚Äù (service to mankind)   (Jois, 2021)  , as we are currently not allowed to perform any voluntary work due to the severity of the virus and the pandemic regulations thereof.  (""Volunteering during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic"", 2021) .On the bright side, this taught me not to look so far to provide service to others, as I am able to help those around me, be it those who are in need of basic necessities or those who are in need of menial tasks, service to mankind cannot be measured by the importance of the support you provide, but rather the act of helping.', 'And then came the\xa0‚Äúvaccines‚Äù, this is probably one of the most controversial topics in discussion at the moment. I don‚Äôt think any of us have done as much research about medication, side effects and general health prior to this pandemic. With only 13.2% of our population vaccinated   (""Before you continue"", 2021)  , and the remainder uneasy about receiving it, we face a drastic issue as we need to be vaccinated in order to return to our previous quality of living.\xa0', 'Thus, we as a society need to stay educated and updated on the current affairs and status of this pandemic, in order to make quality decisions that will not only benefit ourselves but those we love and care about, and the only way we can achieve this is by maintaining our strength even through the face of difficulties, and most importantly together as one.', 'References:', 'Before you continue.

This pandemic has influenced the whole planet with its major impacts on the economy and businesses across the globe. The COVID-19 spread worldwide in unprecedented ways due to its high infectious and contagious nature. As a result, the greatest medical challenge in the 21st century is yet to be faced by physicians worldwide. Though the emergence of the\xa0virus\xa0can be traced back to Asia, many European countries, along with the U.S., have been struck massively by the pandemic. The virus has spread across all regions ranging from North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa up to South America. The COVID- 19 has been declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) due to its increased spread across the globe. After the declaration of the pandemic, various countries announced the complete lockdown, such as Russia, Europe, and many Asian countries in order to decrease its spread. During this pandemic of COVID-19, the rising prevalence of respiratory disorders and increasing demand for peak flow meters in hospitals due to\xa0airborne\xa0infectious diseases are accelerating the market growth amid this pandemic, the demand for ventilators,\xa0humidifiers, respiratory inhalers. According to the situation report of 8th June 2021 by WHO stated 173 million cases of coronavirus patients had been reported globally, and 3.7 million patients have died due to the coronavirus. America is leading in cumulative cases with a record of 68 million and 1.8 million death rates. At the same time, nearly 1.45 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered globally. The outbreak of COVID-19 is having a huge impact on the healthcare and supply chain of various medical products, including peak flow meters.', 'The color code zones from peak flow meters help to detect when a patient should visit the doctor. The green zone determines that breathing is stable, yellow zone determines caution where a patient might have to increase the medication plans. The red zone indicates the dangerous situation where emergency care must be implemented.', 'Peak flow meters allow patients to regularly monitor breathing changes by detecting airway narrowing before getting noticing symptoms. They are easily portable and convenient in usage by blowing air through the mouthpiece of the\xa0device, which can measure the flow rate of air in liters per minute. These are available for usage by adults and young children of age 5. For instance, in asthma conditions, the device helps in tracking the control of breathing over time and helps to recognize the timely suitable treatment when required.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the peak flow meters market from its niche pedestal to the mainstream sector. Even before the pandemic, the peak flow meters and based products were in high demand due to rising chronic respiratory diseases and advanced methods for treatments of various diseases globally.', 'For instance,', '¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As per World Health Organization, around 65 million people have moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), out of which about 3 million die each year. These states respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of death.', '¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 World Health Organization also states about 334 million people suffer from asthma, which accounts for around 14% of children globally.', 'The rising transmission rate of coronavirus in the recent scenario has made high hospital admissions for various chronic diseases, and respective demand for respiratory ventilators and devices like peak flow meters are highly prevailing in the market. Peak flow meters could be used for measuring the force of air from the lungs to help in maintaining the asthma level of patients. Peak flow meters are portable and easy to use, which makes them more convenient for people to rely on. Regular use of this device will help the patient in maintaining their respiratory tract and thus, helps in detecting disorders earlier.', 'For instance,', '¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As per World Health Organization, globally, at least 2 billion people are getting exposed to toxic industrial smokes of biomass fuels and burned gases which are released from poorly ventilated indoor stoves or fireplaces. This has dramatically increased respiratory illness among people irrespective of age.', 'The rising conditions of covid19 cases have further boosted the market growth due to the high requirement of oxygen level measurement at a constant time period. The rising home care facilities enabled for the elderly population with asthma and chronic respiratory conditions are aided by peak flow meters due to their easy application and less complex nature. These affirmative factors boost the demand for peak flow meters among healthcare professionals and customers.', 'This increases the demand for peak flow meters in the market. Several companies operating in other domains are eager to enter, and some have already entered the landscape of the peak flow meters market to increase their revenue by meeting the emergent need of various hospitals for respiratory ventilators and products. The demand is further rising in local clinics and small laboratories due to high awareness of the disease due to coronavirus.', 'The COVID-19 has created a great impact on the supply chain of peak flow meters. The sudden attack of COVID-19 and its subsequent impact on restrictions on trade and movement of goods has resulted in a shutdown of vast countries globally, resulting in disrupted supply chains due to limited materials and workforce, and slow down or stopping of manufacturing. Moreover, several manufacturing companies are retooling priority manufacturing to produce other essential medical supplies and equipment such as ventilators and peak flow meters; due to an increase in order from the consumers, the government has allowed the movement of transport vehicles to import and export the products which are highly required by hospitals and other healthcare sectors. Additionally, the manufacturers are also taking crucial steps to ensure the availability of raw materials by and also they have to look into the quality of products. Manufacturers need to take necessary steps about production processes, shifting to other facilities if required, changes in quality assurance, costs and procedures related to screening of workforce and offering of care if needed, changes in working hours, and others in order to maintain their supply chain.', 'To manage such a crucial situation, many organizations are looking forward to improving and diversified the supply chain model in all aspects. The resulting COVID-19 pandemic has shown the various ways for supply chain management, which may be effective by innovative solutions initiated by market players. \xa0', 'To minimize the supply chain crises, the government has been firmly monitoring the supply chain to assume that the COVID-19 outbreak may adversely impact the supply chain of a medical product, including shortages of ventilators and peak flow meters for various purposes in healthcare sectors in countries globally or potential disruptions in supply chains.', 'COVID 19 had a devastating impact on the global economy. Several establishments have to remain shut while others scale down their operations or put on hold expansion plans as they tried to survive the unprecedented crisis. However, the demand for respiratory devices, disposables, and measurement devices is rising due to increasing respiratory disorders and COVID-19. In spite of lockdowns and supply disruption crises during this pandemic, the companies are managing online sales for peak flow meters and their products. They are also maintaining fair prices owing to the high demand of these products in the market, but due to supply chain disruption price has risen slightly.', 'For instance,', '¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Netmeds sells their peak flow meter ‚ÄúBreathe O Meter Device 1‚Äôs,‚Äù which is a famous product of Cipla for Asthma and COPD at (INR 362.03) 4.88 USD.', 'The covid-19 impact has not affected the price of peak flow meters-based products at a high level because of advanced online sales and innovative delivery options available with utmost safety concerns.', 'The key players engaged in the global peak flow meters market are making improvements to keep the speed during COVID-19. They are taking every single choice cautiously so the development can be expanded on a consistent schedule for the market. The manufacturers are likewise giving a great deal of consideration in the improvement of inventive items that can be utilized for the attractive impacts. Organizations working in the peak flow meters market are embracing a few systems, including joint effort, arrangements, association, and market development to improve their business.', 'For instance,', '¬∑\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Vyaire Medical is one of the top players in the peak flow meter market. The company has taken the initiative in donating medical supplies and peak flow meters to India. They‚Äôve donated five Vela ventilators and two CPAP/BIPAP and oxygen concentrators to the Delhi E.N.T. Hospital, 100 Bellavista ventilators onsite for distribution in Delhi N.C.R., and 500 oxygen concentrators planned for distribution throughout India.', 'These essential choices by the organizations are required to give huge occasions to the market players working in the peak flow meters market.', 'The impact of the novel COVID 19 virus is expected to leave a long-lasting impact on each healthcare sector. The outbreak of COVID 19 prompted citizens to deal with confusion regarding the virus and its management. The virus poses a risk not just to human life but has caused economic distress and severe emotional strain. It produced a ripple effect that gave rise to a new collection of requirements and needs that were not much needed earlier, and an essential one is the peak flow meters and medicinal products, which are highly needed in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and home healthcare setups due to rising chronic diseases and surgical emergence globally.', 'Moreover, many international governments, including U.S., Europe, and Asia‚Äôs healthcare organizations, have supported the supply of these products due to high priority in this crucial health crisis period. Many government bodies and significant market players are closely associated with patients as well as pharma industries for safe packaging of products considering contagious nature of virus and improvement of future economics.', 'It is estimated that the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak having a positive impact on the growth of the market owing to the enormous requirement and application of peak flow meters for respiratory disorders, chronic pulmonary conditions, asthma, and among more will resume with steady ease of supply restrictions by the government.']"

A healthcare worker‚Äôs perspective.', '""I am a healthcare worker who has volunteered to be a part of the COVID ICU ‚Äúproning team‚Äù at the hospital where I work. I am writing this because my colleagues and I had a long discussion today about how disconnected the public is when it comes to the harsh reality of this virus and what it does to people. I will describe in as much detail as possible what you should expect to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù when you get critically ill from COVID-19. ', 'By the time I meet you in the hospital, you‚Äôre already intubated in the ICU. This means that you likely started feeling terrible enough to get yourself to a hospital and then got admitted into said hospital. Your condition worsened to the point that the medical team determined that your best chance of survival would be to place you in a medically-induced coma and hook you up to a ventilator that literally breathes for you. The process that leads up to this point is traumatic, terrifying, and lonely. You are allowed zero visitors and your only interactions are with strangers that come into your room unannounced, wearing what look to you like hazmat suits. The hospital you‚Äôre staying in isn‚Äôt equipped with enough ‚Äúnegative-pressure‚Äù rooms to contain the virus and keep it from spreading to the hallway so there will be a giant window unit that pumps all the air from your room out the window vs allowing it back into the hospital. This window unit is LOUD (similar to a generator) and it will drive you absolutely insane because it MUST be running 24/7. So, you‚Äôre just going to have to accept that. As terrible as all this external hell feels, it‚Äôs nothing compared to what‚Äôs going on internally. Your body is deteriorating. Every breath is a gasp. Turning over to face the door when you hear a knock is impossible because you are literally THAT exhausted. Your oxygen levels continue to drop, even though you are being pumped MASSIVE amounts of pure oxygen through your nose (which is now bleeding constantly because it is completely dried out). The oxygen levels drop so low that the only course of action is to make you comatose, give you a paralyzing agent so you don‚Äôt thrash, and place you on a ventilator. Ok, so NOW let‚Äôs get to the bad part. ', 'You‚Äôre laying on a bed, on your back. Unconscious, naked, Foley catheter in your urethra, and maybe (if your nurse is lucky) a FlexiSeal in your anus to collect all your diarrhea (look it up if you have questions). A ventilator is placed down your throat, somewhere between 20-28centimeters down. It will probably move around if it‚Äôs not tethered, which is a no-no, so it will be taped to your head/face. We‚Äôll come back to this later, because that tape will eventually mess up your face, maybe permanently. A feeding tube goes down your nose because comatose people can‚Äôt eat, obviously. So your diet is now a nutrient-packed yellow mushy soup. Yum! Ok this is the basic setup. ', '', 'Even with all this medically-engineered hoopla, you continue to deteriorate. The ventilator is running 100% oxygen down your throat, into your lungs but still not enough is getting into your blood. This is where organ failure starts to happen. Kidney failure, brain damage, etc. And this is where me and my ‚Äúproning team‚Äù show up at your door. ', '', 'Prone = laying on your stomach. ', '', 'Supine = laying on your back. ', '', 'Proning = turning you from your stomach onto your back.', '', 'Why do we do this? Well, to simplify it, the back of your lungs are bigger and better at oxygenating your blood. But when you‚Äôre laying on your back, all the fluid (LOTS of fluid) in your lungs accumulates and fills the back of your lungs - thus drowning them and making them much less effective. Flipping you onto your stomach causes that fluid to move to the front of your lungs (because gravity), freeing up the back of your lungs to do their better job. Honestly, it‚Äôs pretty amazing to see how quickly you will go from 79% oxygen (SpO2) to 93% as soon as we turn you onto your stomach. It‚Äôs very satisfying for us. Makes us feel proud. We‚Äôll pat you on the back, literally, and give you kudos for this oxygen accomplishment. ', '', 'We will plan to leave you in this prone position for somewhere between 12 to 18 hours. Your head is turned to the side, otherwise the ventilator tube would be rammed through the back of your mouth. Don‚Äôt worry, we will position this for you, you‚Äôre paralyzed, remember? ', '', 'Once those 12 - 18 hours are up, the prone team comes back in to flip you back over to supine. This is where things can get ugly. Being paralyzed and on your stomach leads to A LOT of swelling/edema. Especially in your face. Your tongue has swelled up to ~5x it‚Äôs normal size and it doesn‚Äôt fit in your mouth anymore. Lips swell x5 times, too. Your eyelids have been taped shut but they‚Äôre swollen too. It looks like you have golf balls under your eyelids. Now, remember that tape that holds the ventilator tube in place? Well, it‚Äôs still holding tight. And with all the face/mouth swelling, I should emphasize the word TIGHT. You‚Äôll be in this condition for a while. Maybe a week, maybe two, maybe three. That tape will get replaced daily but it will do some damage to your skin, especially your lips and ears. And since your blood isn‚Äôt getting proper oxygen, your body isn‚Äôt great at healing wounds. So, expect your face to look a little different for a LONG time, if you make it out alive. I now can say that I have seen a living person‚Äôs cheekbones. Not the form of the cheekbones, but the ACTUAL bones, because their wounds on their cheeks got so bad that the flesh necrotized and sloughed off during the friction involved with a head turn. ', '', 'Where were we? Oh yes, we just flipped you back to supine. The 5 of us will be doing some routine care on you: wiping you down with Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) wipes, putting Venelex cream and Mepilex patches your bed sores (think bony prominences - knees, clavicles, sternum, shoulders, nipples, shins, cheeks, etc.), using a suction device to suck up all the secretions from your mouth and nose, cleaning up your diarrhea from EVERYWHERE and changing that pesky face tape. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll be gentle. ', '', 'Now, it‚Äôs been maybe 10-15 minutes on your back. We stand back and assess how you‚Äôre doing. If you‚Äôre a champ, your oxygen levels stay in the low/mid 90s and we can leave you like this for 1 to 8 hours before you start deteriorating again, at which point it‚Äôs back onto your stomach. ', '', 'The idea is that each time we put you back in supine, you‚Äôll be able to maintain longer and longer periods of time before your oxygen drops to the 80s or 70s (or 60s, 50s, 40s, you get it). ', '', 'The longer you‚Äôre in this ICU situation, the worse it gets. Eventually, we have to start doing all the routine care from the side-lying position, because putting you on your back could literally kill you. The supine position becomes intolerable - your blood pressure starts to plummet, your heart skips beats or shoots up to the 200s (or just stops) and your oxygen level drops immediately. So, unfortunately, you go back onto your stomach. More swelling, yay! Repeat this process daily and hope for better results each time. The more often we have to repeat, the less likely you are to survive, because it‚Äôs an indicator of how poorly your lungs are recovering. ', '', 'Now, this is the point where someone might ask, ‚Äúwhy are you keeping this person alive? Isn‚Äôt it inhumane to prolong this person‚Äôs suffering? What quality of life will they have when/if they survive?‚Äù Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not our choice. Even more unfortunately, it‚Äôs likely not even YOUR choice. Who‚Äôs choice is it? Your Medical Power of Attorney (MPOA), which 9 times out of 10, is a family member. Now, remember, there are zero visitors allowed for COVID-19 patients. That means that your family is getting ALL the information about your condition from a phone call or texts messages from someone on the healthcare team. Your family can‚Äôt see you and they can‚Äôt talk to you. Thus, they simply cannot appreciate just how much you are suffering. How could they? It‚Äôs not their fault. They love you. They‚Äôre praying for you. They‚Äôre wondering if they are making the right choice but they are doing so without all the information, because a phone call from a doctor or case manager can only go so far. ', '', 'Above all, they are holding on to hope. Hope that you‚Äôll come back from this. That you‚Äôll be that patient in that next news video that gets the standing ovation as they‚Äôre wheeled out of the hospital because YOU MADE IT. And I hope you do, too. We all do. We care about you. If you make it out of that ICU, you‚Äôve got months of rehab ahead of you. Your fight for life has JUST started. The success story is that, against all odds, you didn‚Äôt die. ', 'Or, maybe you did. As I write this, 170,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the US alone. Each one of those people had a story, a life, a family, dreams, goals and a future. So many of them suffered tremendously through their last days, with strangers. Now they‚Äôre gone, forever. And that ICU bed is ready for the next one. I hope it‚Äôs not you. I hope it‚Äôs not your mom, dad, grandpa, aunt, sister, child or neighbor. But if it is, you can count on me and my coworkers to be gentle with you and treat you with dignity and respect. We will do everything in our power to get you home. This virus doesn‚Äôt care about your political affiliations, your plans, your freedoms. It doesn‚Äôt care about you at all. So we will. ', 'Now, if I may.....please wear your damn mask.', 'Edit: The title says ‚Äúwhen you get critically ill.‚Äù Emphasis on the ‚Äúcritically ill.‚Äù This is NOT what the average person should expect when they test positive. Most people DONT get critically ill. The VAST majority of people will never even see a regular hospital room, much less the ICU - I tested positive and I recovered at home with no medical intervention. Most will have mild symptoms and then recover. That being said, this post reflects a real possibility and a current reality for many people. I want people to understand the harsh reality of COVID-19. It affects everyone differently and taking small, practical precautions can keep you from ever having to wonder ‚Äúis this going to happen to me?‚Äù or ‚Äúdid I get grandma sick because I didn‚Äôt take this seriously?‚Äù I apologize that this came off as fear mongering.

The new ""Covid19 Tests"" that have been sent out over the past 2 months by the CDC, to hospitals, drive up testing centers, and local clinics, have been AMPLIFIED with the parameters of infection being much much lower! Meaning they can test for the very smallest microbe of what they can ASSUME to be ""Covid"", and the test can come back ""positive"".. needing very very little to get positive results. On the CDC\'s website, they admit that they hold back IMPORTANT TESTING MATERIALS that are in short supply. THE MORE THAT PEOPLE GET TESTED, THE MORE CASES WE WILL HAVE.', 'Stop listening to people like Dr Fauci who tells people to stay home, don\'t get sick, and eventually get the vaccine. Start living your life and stop living in Fear. We\'ve tried the method of ""shelter in place"" for way too long. IT DOESN\'T WORK. I\'ve been saying this for 7 months. In New York we\'ve had the most draconian measures, and OBEDIENCE TO THOSE MEASURES, than anywhere else in the United States. People have been staying home for many months, their bodies haven\'t been getting exposed to the normal things that they\'ve always been getting exposed to when outside(certain pathogens, bacterias, etc.). So when everyone was staying home brainwashed and scared, their immune systems have been heavily declining. So when they do eventually go outside, their immune systems start going into overdrive, and this is when people get sick. Because these mainstream doctors anda hospitals aren\'t telling people to take D3 or vitamin c. Even with the mask(that does nothing), people are still getting sick. If your immune system is down and you get exposed to something that\'s essentially benign, your gonna start secreting mucus, and histamines, and all this other stuff that will create an environment that will be conducive for those pathogen to take hold. With a strong immune system, it won\'t take hold. This is also why it\'s a good idea to consume local/raw organic honey. Because it is contains many antigens to keep the immune system strong.', 'People need to be outside in the environment. Kids need to be out playing in the dirt and sand.. so they DON\'T get sick. A lot of these parents stop their kids from going outside and playing, then they start to developing asthma, and allergies, an other things like that. We aren\'t creating a world around us, that we\'re not trusting out neighbors, we\'re being brainwashed to think that everyone is sick. And no one is thinking about the detriment to the kids. You think it\'s a healthy to have a mask on when they\'re in school all day? Just from a breathing perspective. It can also effect their brain\'s oxygen flow. This is child abuse. And what about the psychological effects on the kids, that this PLANdemic(pandemic) is having? Is no one thinking about this? There\'s no way it\'s right or moral to send kids back to school, having to wear a mask all day, not being able to socialize and play with their friends. Most kids already don\'t like going to school, so having to go there with all these restrictions is NOT going to end well. Children, let alone people, are very social beings. They cannot be isolated. They need love, physical touch, and interaction. I\'ve always been a big proponent of home schooling, so money that is allocated to teachers unions should be available for parents to do home schooling or to find alternative private teaching sessions. No one should accept this ""New Normal"" way of life. This is not appropriate. Do not send any kids back to school, until things are how they were before this #PLANdemic.', 'Fauci and the establishment want you to stay home, hunker down, and keep using all this technology that emits tons of radiation, social distance, and wear masks all day every day, so you get sicker, so you can take the vaccine.

I am so sorry. My thoughts are with you and your family.\xa0', 'I originally answered to you after having misread - and I thought you said the doctors told you he did have it although he didn‚Äôt. So I answered thinking he was misdiagnosed and then I deleted my answer which is why I reply like this now.\xa0', 'Nevertheless, the points I made there weren‚Äôt very different. I thought it was a case of doctor incompetence / test unreliability but it turns out it was to a criminal level. I think your family could press charges against that hospital / doctors? Also, I am curious where you‚Äôre from. Different countries might follow different protocols according to how much coronavirus has affected each of them.\xa0', 'I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre from Greece, right? The biggest scandal in Greece associated with the virus was the death of an otherwise healthy 37 year old when he got infected because the protocol states that patients should be admitted to hospitals only if they have very serious symptoms. So nobody took him seriously fast enough because he was young and healthy and what could possibly happen to him but coronavirus killed the man all the same. So, as you see, it is the opposite experience to the one your family had. And both resulted in death. Both patients were victims of the coronavirus. The young man was an immediate victim as well as a victim of doctors not knowing how to deal with the situation and your grandfather was a victim of the chaos of confusion the virus has created in the medical community. I do not condemn the confusion itself as it is expected in this novel situation but I do condemn the circumstances at which the doctors you had chose to follow the protocol.\xa0', 'Now, I will try to reason a little as to why that protocol is the way it is. First of all, I make the assumption that you live in a country with many cases or many casualties. Was your grandfather admitted to the hospital to have some surgical procedure? This could only remotely make sense if the hospital had so many COVID-19 cases that the statistics were for your grandpa to get infected in there rather than not. We have to stress that what they gave your grandpa was not the\xa0‚Äúcure‚Äù. There is not such a thing as a COVID-19 cure, otherwise everything would be okay. What they gave him is an experimental blend of drugs that might or might not have some positive effects on people infected by coronavirus. This experimental blend can also slightly vary from country to country or hospital to hospital. These drugs are not designed for coronavirus and if they help at all, it‚Äôs because of a similar structure of the virus with what they are actually fighting and blah blah blah. What I mean is that they help somewhat and incidentally. They sort of prevent the virus to multiply or spread in multiple systems inside the body but they do not destroy it. If your grandfather had to have a surgery or stay for a prolonged time in the hospital, they probably calculated that it was statistically extremely likely that he would get the virus as well, and then because of his age and (IDK) probably already fragile health (?) he would most definitely die, so they chose to give him the\xa0‚Äútreatment‚Äù as a preventive measure against contracting the virus. Now, the drugs used in this treatment are no laughing matter / some of them are heavy, they come with a lot of side effects and they need medical attention near you when you take them. If your grandpa was already in bad health it was very possible that those drugs would do more bad than good and it was a grave, criminal miscalculation from the doctors‚Äô part.\xa0', 'On the other hand, if you are from Greece or a country with few recorded cases / casualties and your grandpa was otherwise very healthy and robust or seriously ill but without covid cases around him and they still did that, I do not know what to say because there is simply no reasoning to make. Perhaps there are legal procedures you should follow against that hospital.\xa0', 'These drugs have helped many patients with medium or severe symptoms to get through it. These drugs had no effect whatsoever on other patients, who either survived or died from the virus regardless. And these drugs also caused severe side effects to a few and your grandfather must have been sadly one of these. Unless of course there are more miscalculations on the doctors‚Äô part that they are not fully revealing to you, things that could also be irrelevant to the COVID treatment. And all those different outcomes are explained simply by the fact that coronavirus is not what these drugs were originally designed to fight.\xa0', 'However, even in this case, the ultimate culprit was the virus. The virus is the immediate cause of many deaths but also the cause of this chaos and confusion in the medical community that does not know how to react. The government protocol exists because there is evidence it has helped some infected people compared to the absolute nothingness of no treatment at all. It‚Äôs a choice of despair. It is bad but it is not a plan to purge the population. There was no ill intention against your grandfather but a bunch of bad or simply confused or desperate doctors following a generalized protocol that didn‚Äôt take into account the parameters of your grandfather‚Äôs case. Needless to say, I downright object to the application of a generalized protocol that doesn‚Äôt examine needs unique to each patient but I think this responsibility falls on the doctor‚Äôs judgement mostly and I am sure it is not a mass murder / control attempt by whichever government.\xa0 I‚Äôm so very sorry, I understand that right now little does it matter to you what the intent was as long as the mistake was heartwrenching and irreversible.', 'But please understand that the point I am trying to make comes from a place of worry and need for this nightmare to end for all of us. In my opinion, this can happen only if we all take seriously what is going on or at least respect the boundaries of those who do. I am not talking about consuming heavy drugs without reason / evidence of course. If we did that, we might as well just follow Trump‚Äôs advices, drink bleach and just die all together. No no no. Besides, I said in a previous reply\xa0‚Äúdo not rely on the medical community for the time being‚Äù. The only thing we need to rely on\xa0 for now is our ability to protect ourselves and our loved ones and this can only happen when you remove yourself a little from unnecessary social interactions or protecting your face in necessary ones. Does anyone think I am having a good time when I do that? Of course not. Who would. But we should understand that only like this we will eventually find our way out of this dystopia, at least until a medicine or a vaccine is designed. It is not the time for Orwell fantasies.\xa0', 'Again, my sincere condolences. What happened to your grandpa was terrible and should probably be further investigated.

Breathing in through the nose delivers NO directly into the lungs, where it helps fight coronavirus infection by blocking the replication of the coronavirus in the lungs. But many people who exercise or engage in yoga also receive the benefits of inhaling through the nose instead of the mouth. The higher oxygen saturation of the blood can make one feel more refreshed and provides greater endurance.I am one of three pharmacologists who won the Nobel Prize in 1998 for discovering how nitric oxide is produced in the body and how it works.‚Äù', 'Question: how effective is NO against Covid19?\xa0', 'A: Nitric Oxide inhibits SARS-CoV-2‚Ä≤s replication cycle ON CONTACT.\xa0https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/3/1966', 'A: Inhaled Nitric Oxide is being tested as a treatment for Covid19 patients and shortens the intensity and duration of illness:\xa0https://www.healio.com/news/primary-care/20200520/evidence-mounts-supporting-inhaled-nitric-oxide-as-covid19-treatment', 'A: Similar treatments have been used aganst SARS in hospitals.\xa0https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/39/10/1531/460542', 'Question: How can one increase NO levels on their own in the absence of access to inhaled NO?', 'A: Nitric Oxide is increased 15x by humming.\xa0https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200202-138BC', 'Question: Humming increases Nitric Oxide in the airways up to ~500/800ppb.

After symptomatic improvement, a stepwise reduction in nitric oxide was implemented from day 13 to 17, with the dose dropping to 10 ppm, 5 ppm, and then 0 ppm.‚Äù"", 'Summary/Takeaway: Increasing NO levels could possibly be beneficial as a preventative against Covid-19 and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt\xa0to do so. NO is produced all over the body and can be increased intracellularly through eating leafy greens, celery and especially beets. However direct application of NO on possibly contaminated respiratory tissues can be achieved through nasal inhalation, and the amount of NO inhaled can be increased by humming the previous exhale, and by breathing in slowly which increases the length of time of NO release. Used in conjunction with mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing, humming and inhaling NO may be a useful immune boosting practice to limit the ability for any stray viral particles to replicate in one‚Äôs respiratory tract.', 'Furthermore (AND REMEMBER I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL OF ANY SORT AND YOU MIGHT BE WISE TO DISREGARD WHAT I SAY) Covid19 seems to decrease NO in the body by damaging respiratory tissue, simultaneously causing lowered oxygenation and reducing the body‚Äôs ability to fight viral infection as well as causing constriction and damage to blood vessels (remember that nitric oxide relaxes tissues and keeps them supple) which may also account for the kinds of blood vessel damage seen in advanced cases. Given this, it seems absolutely vital that all individuals maximize their NO and oxygenation through breathing exercises before and in the case of contracting Covid, as doing so provides antiviral benefit and counteracts the blood vessel damage this disease is capable of.', 'Other interesting factors/readings: (these are more complicateed and go beyond the scope of my suggestions)', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860320301610', '---', '‚ÄúAbstractThe nasal cavity and turbinates play important physiological functions by filtering, warming and humidifying inhaled air. Paranasal sinuses continually produce nitric oxide (NO), a reactive oxygen species that diffuses to the bronchi and lungs to produce bronchodilatory and vasodilatory effects. Studies indicate that NO may also help to reduce respiratory tract infection by inactivating viruses and inhibiting their replication in epithelial cells. In view of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), clinical trials have been designed to examine the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 subjects. We discuss here additional lifestyle factors such as mouth breathing which may affect the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by bypassing the filtering effect of the nose and by decreasing NO levels in the airways. Simple devices that promote nasal breathing during sleep may help prevent the common cold, suggesting potential benefits against coronavirus infection. In the absence of effective treatments against COVID-19, the alternative strategies proposed here should be considered and studied in more detail.Keywords: Innate immunity, Coronavirus, COVID-19, Nitric oxide, Breathing‚Äù', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200356/']"

Things would have gone far better for Brazil had some erroneous  decisions not been made. The over 130,000 lost lives and four million  infections were not inevitable, and the country did not have to put into  practice an incredibly failed approach to deal with the novel  coronavirus.', 'First,  Brazil had a three-week headstart to prepare for and cope with a  worst-case scenario. As the situation began to spiral out of control in  Europe in February, Brazil had the opportunity to learn from those  mistakes and enact public policy intervention at the central level. But  this did not happen. There was time, but no political will whatsoever.  Shockingly, President Jair Bolsonaro‚Äôs health ministry had no  contingency plan to deal with epidemiclike events even when the crisis  sprung up.[1]', 'Second,  airports across the country should have been shut as early as March  when the global health emergency was worsening elsewhere. International  flights to and from Brazil are concentrated in two cities‚ÄîS√£o Paulo and  Rio de Janeiro‚Äîmaking it possible to seal Latin America‚Äôs air hubs and  introduce a China-inspired ‚Äòcordon sanitaire‚Äô strategy. But, again,  there was not much governmental interest in blocking this menace.[2] As a consequence, the first batch of COVID-19 cases were mostly imported from Italy, quickly spreading throughout Brazil.[3]', 'Third,  Brazil was expected to resist the overwhelming pressure on its public  health apparatuses due to the Sistema √önico de Sa√∫de (SUS), a mechanism  introduced in the 1988 federal constitution to provide the population  with the widest universal coverage health system on earth. SUS mobilises  around three million health workers and is territorially widespread,  reaching even the most inhospitable places and assisting more than 150  million citizens who cannot rely on private health insurance. While it  should be a reason for national pride, SUS has been underfunded for many  years now, which poses serious challenges to its proper functioning.[4]', 'Brazil has been hard hit by the COVID-19  pandemic. As of late August, it had the second highest cumulative deaths  and confirmed cases, behind only the US. The Brazilian economy may  contract by 6 percent to 10 percent this year, and the pace of recovery  is not the most encouraging. Of all South American nations, only  Venezuela is bound to deliver worse economic results in the aftermath of  the pandemic.[5]  Unemployment in Brazil has reached an all-time high (more than 12  million people are unemployed, as of July) and more than 100 million  citizens are believed to depend on governmental financial relief  programmes to survive this crisis.[6]', 'Unemployment in Brazil has  reached an all-time high (more than 12 million people are unemployed, as  of July) and more than 100 million citizens are believed to depend on  governmental financial relief programmes to survive this crisis ', 'This despairing public health scenario was  aggravated by two pre-existing ‚Äòco-morbidities‚Äô‚Äîan economic depression  that led the Brazilian economy to shrink and return to the levels of the  early 2010s,[7]  and an ongoing process of social polarisation and struggles to win  control of the country, in a fierce dispute against the presidency by  two other federal branches (the legislative and the judiciary) and  sub-national authorities (mayors and state governors).

Prior to this recent order, the Netherlands carried out a culling program that terminated the lives of tens of thousands of mink. As we noted in a previous post, press photographer Olivier Middendorp lost his court case to be allowed to photograph the cull. Via @dutchnewsnl: ""Judges sided with the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, who argued the presence of the photographer would present ‚Äòtoo great a danger to public health‚Äô. Middendorp had argued photographing the mass cull had ‚Äòsocial significance‚Äô given that it is likely to happen again."" . Lack of transparency is one of the many strategies this industry employs to keep the general public in the dark about the violence that is inherent to these operations. .

They took Jesus‚Äô body and, following the Jewish burial custom, wrapped it in linen with the spices.  There was a garden near the place he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been placed.  So, because it was Sabbath preparation for the Jews and the tomb was convenient, they placed Jesus in it.', '1 Peter 4:1 and 6 (ESV) ', 'Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,', '6 For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.', 'Reflection:', 'Holy Saturday is the link between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.  Today is a vigil pause between the cross and the resurrection.(1)  Holy Saturday is that ""in between time."" (2)  As much as we may wish that we could ignore the fact that we are caught in-between, we cannot ignore the in-between periods of our lives.  We are not given the privilege of skipping Holy Saturday in our lives.(3)  Our province and our country are stuck in Holy Saturday.  The Coronavirus pandemic struck.  Many businesses closed temporarily, some to never open again.  At times early in the pandemic, things felt unnatural ‚Äì just way too quiet.  And the price of oil plummeted.  We are still waiting for the normal to return.  Spiritually, we caught in a holding zone.  The crucifixion is passed, but the full glory of the resurrection is not here yet.(4) Holy Saturday 2021, for some of us, feels like over a year of Holy Saturdays.  The Coronavirus lockdown is a brutally long, anxious, and vulnerable time.', 'Even children have Holy Saturday moments.  When I was a kid, there were times when my punishment was to sit quietly on a kitchen chair.  No talking was allowed.  I could sit in the chair, okay, but no talking was rough.  The three to five minutes timeouts felt like an eternity.  I think my silent timeouts might have been more challenging for my mother than they were for me because I just could not keep quiet.', ""Canada is still sitting on the kitchen chair - over a year later.  McDougall United Church is sitting on the chair for a second Easter.  The Holy Saturday moments in life feel like they are an eternity long.  During the pandemic, the Holy Saturday moments for children are especially challenging.  Many children had to take courses online and were cut off from their friends and classmates for weeks, even months.  Children learning at home have to try to navigate a dual relationship with their parents, where their parents might be functioning both in both a teacher's role and in a parent's role.  And a special place dedicated to learning, school, no longer exists.  Learning takes place in the home, the same place where children live and play.  As with my time-out moments, the shift to learning at home can be difficult for parents too.  Being plunged into a quasi-teaching role with almost no time to shift gears is difficult."", ""Jesus is gone ‚Äì dead and buried.  The disciples lost their teacher and friend, Jesus' family lost a son and a brother.  The region of Palestine lost a dynamic itinerant rabbi.  Jesus was executed for being a potential source of discontent against the government and the religious leadership, which were closely related. Jesus' disciples and family were deep in shock, possibly dealing with anger and fear.  They may feel very vulnerable.  What if someone falsely accuses them, just like they falsely accused Jesus?  When you are hiding, hoping nobody is thinking of you or coming for you, time is painfully slow.  Some people are experiencing are feeling afraid and vulnerable with our COVID Holy Saturday."", 'Hans Steiner, of Stanford University indicates that the social isolation caused by the pandemic Conflicts with our need to ""social interventions"" that help us ""resolve anger"" when we believe that we are ""at the mercy of injustice and uncertainty."" (5) Tensions seem to be high during the pandemic.  There are many possible reasons ‚Äì uncertainty, danger, children\'s education bouncing between school and home, work bouncing back and forth between office and home, job uncertainty, business closures, and extreme incidents of injustice.  We are experiencing loss of loved ones, loss of lifestyle, loss of routines, loss of dreams, and financial loss.  David Rosemarie, assistant professor in the Harvard Medical School\'s Department of Psychiatry, says he is seeing an increase in levels of anger in his practice.(6)  There are times when anxiety and depression can look like anger.(7)  David Rosemarie believes the anger over masks is related to fear over civil rights being taken away. He believes that fear is due to fear of the virus.  Rosemarie observes, ""When we\'re aggressive, we don\'t have to show our vulnerability to other people."" (8)', 'You might be thinking, ""Are there any scientific studies about COVID restrictions contributing to anger.  In the United Kingdom, a study was conducted of over 2,200 participants aged 16‚Äì75 years.  The study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, found that 56% of the participants reported ""having had arguments, feeling angry or fallen out with others because of COVID- 19."" The researchers concluded that COVID-19 restrictions cause ""considerable strain."" (9)  If you are feeling anxious and angry, and you think COVID restrictions might be impacting your behavior, you are not alone.', 'There are many explanations as to what 1 Peter Chapter 4 means.  I am not going to discuss the complex range of opinions.  There might not be a highly definitive meaning for 1 Peter Chapter 4.(10) A few commentators consider the passage to be a mysterious encounter Jesus had with the dead, after Jesus\' death.(11) 1 Peter Chapter 4 can be seen as a symbolic representation of the depth of God\'s love and grace.  Holy Saturday could be the time when Jesus brought the Gospel of saving grace to all of the dead from the preceding ages.  Verses 5-6 could refer to the Gospel going to ""all the dead."" The epistle of 1 Peter seems to be about Christ descending to the ""place of the dead"" to preach to the dead.(12)  I tend to believe that descending into the depth of hell symbolizes the fact that there is no mistake, no sin that God cannot forgive, that nobody is left out of the realm of God\'s grace.  The key takeaway is that God is just.  Judgment is fair, because even those who died before Jesus\' ministry on the cross hear the good news.(13)', 'Jonathan Turtle, an Anglican priest, describes Jesus as descending into the grave and ""taking Adam and Eve by the hand,"" and leading them out of the grave, ""pulling them up out of the grave."" Rowan Williams, when he was the Archbishop of Canterbury, observes that this was not the youthful Adam and Eve.(14)  Like Rowan Williams, I invite you to picture the old Adam and Eve.  I am going to give you a moment to picture Adam and Eve.  I see them as frail, with thin gray hair, arthritic hands, stooped shoulders, and eyes grown dim with age.  I can almost picture them weighed down with a lifetime of guilt and shame.  Then, I can visualize a change, as the fear of meeting God, and as a lifetime of guilt and shame, melts away in the presence of the Christ.', 'Middle Church tweeted, ""Too many Christians act as if the Bible asks us to beat plowshares into swords."" (15)  Sadly, it is not just Christians who act like the Bible says we should beat our plowshares into swords.  At a time fear is causing some tense, anxious, and fearful people to beat their emotional plowshares into swords, and they are living out an angry, grace challenged form of religion.', 'Prayer:', 'Companion God, in our Holy Saturday season, we give you our offering ‚Äì the broken dreams, uncertainty, sense of oppression, anger, anxiety, fear, and depression.

499,rencis14mille,"['RECANA, MILLE RENCIS D.', 'DDM2-A5', 'DENTAL INFORMATICS', '\xa0COVID19: Present and Future ', 'Challenges in the Dental Practice', 'Abstract', 'The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly escalated into a worldwide pandemic, creating a global health and economic crisis. It is a novel virus which is distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with Chinese horseshoe bats being the most probable origin. Transmission occurs primarily through droplet spread or contact routes. Due to the characteristics of dental settings, the risk of cross infection between dental health care personnel (DHCP) and patients can be very high. This article provides a brief overview of the structure of the virus, modes of transmission, and clinical features of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this article is to recommend infection control strategies and patient management protocols to provide optimum dental care and simultaneously prevent nosocomial infection in dental settings.', '1. Introduction', 'Several epidemics (such as H1N1, H5N1, avian influenza, Ebola, SARS, Zika, and Nipah) have affected India and other countries in the past, which were successfully tackled with appropriate research. The emergence of novel human pathogens and re-emergence of several diseases are of particular concern. A novel human coronavirus initially referred to as the Wuhan coronavirus (CoV), currently designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, is responsible for the latest pandemic that is affecting human health and economy across the world. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the Chinese outbreak of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern because of its rampant spread, thus posing a high risk to countries with vulnerable health systems. According to the WHO situation report (14 May 2020) update on COVID-19, there have been more than 42,48,389 reported cases and 2,94,046 deaths worldwide [4]. By imposing a nationwide lockdown, India has curtailed the spread of this virus to a certain extent; however, the total number of reported cases has crossed 78000 with approximately 2500 deaths and these numbers continue to rise.', 'Given the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2, healthcare providers are at an increased risk of contracting the infection and becoming potential carriers of the disease. According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), dental health care personnel (DHCP) are placed in very high exposure risk category as dentists work in close proximity to the patient‚Äôs oral cavity. Also, dental procedures involve the use of rotary instruments such as handpieces and scalers, which generate aerosols. Thus, a greater understanding of the structure of the virus, modes of transmission, clinical features, and testing methods is needed that can help to form protocols for dental practices to identify cases and prevent further spread of infection to the patients and DHCP.', '2. Structure', 'SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Although similar to some betacoronaviruses, it is distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It is a novel virus belonging to the subgenus\xa0sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, with Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) being the most probable origin [6]. It is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a diameter of 60‚Äì140\u2009nm, spherical or elliptical in shape, and pleomorphic that shows a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope (coronam\xa0is the Latin term for crown).', '3. Clinical Manifestations', 'Common symptoms at onset of illness include fever, nonproductive cough, myalgia, or fatigue; less common symptoms are sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea. Another common symptom is pneumonia which can be seen on chest X-ray or chest CT as multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, remarkable in the lung periphery. Organ dysfunctions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury (shock and arrhythmia), acute kidney injury, and death can occur in severe cases. Age and comorbidity have been found to be risk factors for poor outcome.', '3.1. Treatment/Management', 'Clinical management of COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic treatment. Severe cases require respiratory assistance with organ support in intensive care. No specific antiviral treatment exists, but antiviral, antimalarial, and biological drugs are administered in clinical trials.', '\xa04. Transmission', 'Although animal to human transmission was presumed to be the main mechanism, it has now been realised that infected patients, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, are the main sources of transmission of the infection [10]. Current evidence suggests that person to person transmission occurs primarily via droplet spread or contact routes. Transmission via droplets occurs only in cases of close contact (within 1 metre) with those who have respiratory symptoms as there is a risk of oral/nasal mucosa or conjunctiva getting exposed to potentially exposing infected respiratory droplets when the person sneezes, coughs, or talks loudly.', 'In a dental setup, in addition to droplets, procedures on dental patients involving the use of high-speed handpiece or ultrasonic instruments may cause their secretions, saliva, or blood to aerosolize the virus into the surroundings. Thus, transmission can also occur through indirect contact by touching contaminated surfaces followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth. The standard infection control measures which are otherwise followed in daily clinical work will thus not be effective enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19, especially when patients are in the incubation period, are unaware they are infected, or choose to conceal their infection.', '5. Dental Setup', 'DHCP (dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, and receptionists) need to update their knowledge and skills regarding infection control and follow the protocols recommended by the relevant authorities to protect themselves and their patients against infections.', 'An attempt should be made to telephone triage all patients in need of dental care. Teledentistry can be of great assistance in the current pandemic situation. Newer technologies have not only enhanced the quality of management of dental patients but have also made possible their partial or complete management at distances of kilometres away from healthcare centers or dental clinics. The entire process of networking, sharing digital information, distant consultations, workup, and analysis is dealt with by a segment of the science of telemedicine concerned with dentistry known as ‚ÄúTeledentistry‚Äù.', 'Based on the patients‚Äô signs and symptoms, a decision should be made to determine whether the patient needs to be seen in the dental clinic. Appropriate pharmaceuticals and detailed home care instructions should be provided by means of Teledentistry in situations where dental treatment can be delayed.', 'After a decision has been made that the patient needs to visit the dental clinic, the next step should be to evaluate the patients for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection to determine in which clinical setting they should be seen. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, patients with active COVID-19 infection should not be seen in dental settings and should be referred for emergency care where appropriate transmission-based precautions are available.', 'A detailed history should be obtained from the patients by requesting them to fill the screening form for COVID-19 infection which should include the following questions: (1) Do you have fever or have experienced fever within the past 14 days? (2) Have you experienced a recent onset of respiratory problems, such as a cough or difficulty in breathing within the past 14 days? (3) Have you, within the past 14 days, travelled to countries with documented (SARS)-CoV-2 transmission? Or have you come into contact with people who have travelled to these countries? (4) Have you come into contact with a patient with confirmed (SARS)-CoV-2 infection within the past 14 days? (5) Are there people with documented experience of fever or respiratory problems within the last 14 days having close contact with you? (7) Have you recently participated in any gathering, meetings, or had close contact with many unacquainted people?.', 'Upon patient‚Äôs arrival, the body temperature of the patient should be measured using a contact-free forehead thermometer. If the patient answers ‚Äúno‚Äù to all the questions and if the patient is afebrile, the patient can be treated by the dental surgeon following the recommended protocols (Figure\xa01). The ability to test patients who need dental care for SARS-CoV-2 is to be considered in order to restart dentistry in a sustainable way. Tests can be a strong tool to mitigate risks for patients and oral healthcare workers too.', '6. Waiting Room', 'The Indian Dental Association recommends posting visual alert icons like signs and posters at the entrance and in strategic places to provide patients with instructions (in appropriate languages) about hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Instructions should include how to use tissues to cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and to dispose of tissues and contaminated items in waste receptacles and how and when to perform hand hygiene.', 'Appointments should be scheduled such that social distancing can be maintained in the waiting room. Another alternative is for the patient to wait outside or in their vehicle and they can be contacted via telephone when it is their turn to be seen. It is recommended that the patients avoid bringing companions to their appointment, except for instances where the patient requires assistance. This can be communicated to the patient at the time of scheduling an appointment.', '7. During Treatment', 'The National Task Force for Covid-19 constituted by Indian Council of Medical Research recommends the use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of SARS-Cov-2 infection for healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. The recommended dosage is 400\u2009mg twice a day on day 1, followed by 400\u2009mg once weekly for next seven weeks, to be taken with meals.', 'It is recommended that the highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) available is used by dental surgeon and dental assistant while treating patients which includes gloves, gown, head cover, shoe cover, eye protection including goggles or a disposable/reusable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face, and a N954 or higher-level respirator. A combination of a surgical mask and a full-face shield can be used in situations when a respirator is not available.', 'Good hand hygiene is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. A two-before and three-after hand hygiene should be followed in order to reinforce the compliance of hand washing. Specifically, the dental surgeon and the dental assistant should wash their hands before examining a patient, before performing any dental procedures, after touching the patient, after touching the surroundings and equipment without disinfection, and after touching the oral mucosa, blood, damaged skin, or wound.', 'Preprocedural mouth rinse with 0.5‚Äì1% hydrogen peroxide for its nonspecific virucidal activity against viruses or with 0.2% povidone-iodine is recommended as it might reduce the load of corona virus in saliva.', 'Intraoral X-ray examination is the most common radiographic technique in dental imaging; however, it can stimulate saliva secretion and coughing. Therefore, extraoral dental radiographies, such as panoramic radiography and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), are appropriate alternatives during the outbreak of COVID-19.', 'DHCP should avoid aerosol-generating procedures to the best and prioritize the use of hand instruments such as spoon excavators in combination with chemomechanical caries removal agents. However, if aerosol-generating procedure needs to be performed, it should be scheduled as the last appointment of the day. Working from 10 or 11 o‚Äôclock position is recommended. In order to avoid splatter, eight o‚Äôclock position should be avoided. Use of rubber dam during such procedures is recommended as it could significantly reduce airborne particles in approximately three-foot diameter of the operational field by 70%. Four-handed dentistry with high volume suction for aerosols should be implemented along with regular suction. Additional measures such as improving the quality of water, flushing of water from dental unit water lines, using antiretraction valves, antiretraction handpieces, and retrograde aspiration are strongly recommended to prevent cross infection.', '8. Posttreatment', 'Because coronaviruses lose their viability significantly after 72 hours, many organizations have promoted a rotation and reuse strategy. It involves acquiring a set number of N95 masks (at least 5 as per the CDC), and rotate their use each day, allowing them to dry for long enough that the virus is no longer viable. However, N95 respirators used during aerosol generating procedures or those contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids from patients should be discarded.', 'Fumigation is not practical for dental operatory; however, measures such as mopping the floor with 1% sodium hypochlorite and disinfecting waterlines with 0.01% sodium hypochlorite can help reduce the risk of cross infection. All biomedical waste pertaining to patient care should be carefully disposed from time to time through an authorized biomedical disposal agency.', 'Teledentistry as a form of Telehealth provides a pragmatic approach to assess and record the oral health status postoperatively and hence improve the overall delivery of oral care. The dentist can monitor the treatment outcomes using mobile photography ensuring patient confidentiality and also provide educational videos regarding maintenance of oral hygiene for the benefit of the patient. With a paradigm shift in dental care practice in progress during the current pandemic situation, Teledentistry holds the prospects to attend the treatment needs of the patients without confrontation. It not only eliminates any chance of exposure to the virus but also decreases the service cost and helps in patient education and most importantly social distancing can be maintained. Teledentistry has changed the outlook of dentistry and never has it gained a stronger foothold in the practice as it probably holds during these times. So, it becomes imperative that the DHCP embrace this fundamental tool and apply it to its full potential', '9. Conclusion', 'Dental health care personnel need to understand the implications of potential transmission of the (SARS)-CoV-2 virus in a clinical setup. Hence, they need to keep themselves updated with any new information regarding this disease. New approaches such as Teledentistry will help dentists assist patients without adding the risk of cross infection. The recent state of affairs obligates the need to strike a balance between the safety of the healthcare professionals yet providing optimum dental care to the patients requiring emergency intervention.', 'Conflicts of Interest', 'The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.', 'References', '1.\xa0R.

500,luisa-writes,"['Abstract', 'The People Power Revolution sparked change all over the Philippines and liberated the vast majority of Filipinos from oppression and issues of similar nature. Consequently, Filipinos were free from verbal restrainment and have played a huge factor in voicing new ideas, constructive criticism, and analytical thinking in terms of political matters over the decades. Unfortunately, the country still faces corruption and mediocrity from politicians who swore equity and justice. There has seemed to be a conspicuous pattern over the years as to the causes of political corruption and incompetence: political dynasties. The topic of political dynasties has seemed to stir controversy amongst the politically aware, principally because it demotes political competition and historically results in an abuse of powers. In the following pages, the researchers will be tackling comprehensive information about one of the most familiar political dynasties in our generation today, the Cayetano Dynasty. The family‚Äôs background, the beginning of their dynasty, their political history, programs and laws, and issues they are associated with will be introduced and discussed informatively. ', 'Summary', '\xa0The Cayetano dynasty began with Rene Cayetano, a lawyer, journalist, television presenter, and politician who gained recognition for his efforts and sincere devotion to crime prevention and improvement of the criminal justice system. Rene Cayetano was not wealthy during his early political journey as he had been a working student during the time where he was working for a law degree. Despite this, Rene Cayetano was extremely intelligent as he had studied at the University of the Philippines and had even procured a scholarship grant in the United States. Rene Cayetano married Sandra Schramm, and together they had four children. Because of Rene Cayetano‚Äôs popularity and expertise in the field of politics, his children were influenced to undergo the same path he had taken. Rene Cayetano‚Äôs intelligence was naturally passed down to his four children who have graduated from prestigious universities such as the University of the Philippines and Ateneo University. The Cayetanos are presently wealthy, but in contrast to other known politicians, they were not as rich but not entirely poor either. A study had shown that in 2013-2014, Alan Peter Cayetano was one of the poorest members of the Senate with a net worth of 23 million pesos. In 2020, it was shown that Pia Cayetano was listed 10th as one of the richest members of the Senate.', '\xa0Rene Cayetano paved the way for the family‚Äôs political journey to begin when he was the Senator of the Philippines from 1998-2003. Pia Cayetano, his eldest daughter, took office after him in 2004-2016 and 2019-present day. Alan Peter Cayetano, Rene Cayetano‚Äôs eldest son, began his political journey as a member of the Municipality of Taguig from 1992-1995. He, later on, became the Vice Mayor of the Taguig Municipality, a senator from 2007-2017, and is presently a Congressman representing Pateros-Taguig. Ma. Laarni Cayetano, Alan Peter Cayetano‚Äôs wife, also became part of their family‚Äôs dynasty. She became a congresswoman of the Pateros-Taguig in 2007, later became the city‚Äôs mayor in 2010, and finally became a congresswoman in Taguig‚Äôs 2nd district. Rene Cayetano‚Äôs last two sons, Lino Edgardo Cayetano and Renren Cayetano also rose to power just like the other Cayetanos. Lino Edgardo Cayetano became a barangay chairman of Fort Bonifacio in 2010, later became a congressman of the 2nd district, and was elected mayor in 2019. Renren Cayetano was a Muntinlupa councilor in 2001 and ended his career in 2007.', '\xa0The Cayetanos are well-known for their activeness in the field of politics and have even provided significant contributions to the nation. As a senator and former prosecutor, Rene Cayetano was able to legalize a number of republic acts that highlight criminal prevention and improvement. An example is Administrative Order No. 51-96 which designates special criminal courts in cities to hear cases involving heinous crimes and finish the trial within 60 days. Other than this, Rene Cayetano filed Resolution No. 579 to fight for the ban on the collection of parking fees, R.A. 8972 which aims to provide benefits to single Filipino parents, and R.A. 8975 which is an act to ensure implementation and completion of government infrastructure projects by prohibiting lower courts from issuing temporary restraining orders. In addition, Rene Cayetano provided free legal advice to television and radio listeners through a weekly television program entitled ‚ÄúCompanero y Companera.‚Äù ', '\xa0Rene Cayetano‚Äôs eldest daughter, Senator Pia Cayetano, sponsored the ‚ÄúBayanihan to Heal as One Act.‚Äù, alongside several other senators. Pia uploaded promotional videos and statements regarding this as a contribution. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act is an act that outlines the government‚Äôs response to Covid19 and promoted funding for programs for 18 million poor families. Pia also sponsored the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or ‚ÄúBayanihan 2‚Äù, a measure that involves a Post-Covid recovery plan. Other than this, Senator Pia Cayetano established a program named ‚ÄúPilipinas In Action‚Äù or PIA, which is to provide assistance to the vulnerable sectors in the country during the pandemic. ', '\xa0As chairman of the Committee on Education, Alan Peter Cayetano initiated efforts in educational loans and scholarships more accessible to Filipino students; R.A. 9500 or ‚ÄúUniversity of the Philippines Charter Act of 2008‚Äù. He implemented this because he believed that, in order to fight corruption, Filipinos must be empowered and educated. Secondly, as chairman of the Committee on Public Information and Mass Media, Alan Peter Cayetano campaigned for the ‚ÄúFreedom of Information Act‚Äù to become law in order to increase transparency and accountability. This act provides improved access to information for the Filipinos and became a bill in 2012.', '\xa0Despite the Cayetanos‚Äô above-average intelligence and praiseworthy contributions, some of the members of the family have been repeatedly involved in national controversy and problems. One issue that had occurred years back was when Alan Peter Cayetano defended the controversial war on drugs. In an event with Asia Society, he talked about the Philippine war on drugs with a verbal justification that ""The Philippines had no other choice and not acting on it will let drugs take over the Philippines."" He had also stated that all the police brutality and killings were not the root effects of the war on drugs, and these issues had existed beyond the time that the war on drugs was declared. Many Filipinos were infuriated by his defense, \'blind\' vigilantism, and utter confidence during this speech last 2017. ', '\xa0The second issue that the Cayetanos were associated with was when Alan Peter Cayetano launched a congress bloc entitled ""BTS Sa Kongreso"". Much like the South Korean septet that it was based on, the bloc comprised of seven members from the Congress. This bloc received backlash from BTS Fans, fellow politicians, and Filipinos. Senior Deputy Speaker Salvador said that the launching of Cayetanos\' House bloc was ""an obvious publicity stunt and gimmickry."" BTS fans even launched the hashtag #CayetanoStopUsingBTS which trended on Twitter, with over 7,000 tweets. Other fans had decided to take a different route and decided to send an email directly to BTS\' music label, Big Hit Entertainment regarding ""unauthorized use of artist imagery and trademarks in publications"" and spread the notice on Twitter.', '\xa0Alan Peter Cayetano held up a sign ‚ÄúTogether with doctors and frontliners, we went to work for you, so please stay home for us.‚Äù Later on, reports said that politicians and their families were receiving special treatment and getting tested for the Coronavirus despite not showing any symptoms. It was stated in one news article that Cayetano and other politicians were getting tested for COVID-19 not just once but twice despite the utter lack of test kits for the frontliners who are continually and more exposed to the virus. Because of this, #ANGKAKAPAL went viral on social media platforms. ', '\xa0On October 2, 2020, Velasco accused Alan Peter Cayetano of blackmailing Duterte into holding the 2021 budget hostage if his term was not extended. Velasco noted that Cayetano did not want to step down yet from the speakership post at the House of Representatives due to a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù. Velasco appealed to Cayetano to resign as House Speaker on October 14. ', 'Conclusion', 'Isabelle\nThe Cayetano family was able to accomplish great things despite their relatively new presence in the field of politics which contrasts the older and more well-known political dynasties. They have had their fair share of contributions to the nation, but are not entirely along the lines of what is rightfully deemed as ""noble politicians"". Similar to other political dynasties, the Cayetano family has been involved in issues and controversy which shape them to be disputable politicians (in terms of whenever or not they are corrupt or righteous). \xa0 Personally, I commend the family for being politically active, but my doubts are placed on my own personal dilemma. It is hard to say if the Cayetanos are praiseworthy for their political activeness or their willingness to carry out a political dynasty and its deleterious effects.', ""Luisa\nThe Cayetano family had their fair share of politics. They contributed both good and bad projects to our country. It was evident that they went through a lot to get where they are now, they were able to gain a reputation despite not being that well-known. Although I'm grateful for all their positive contributions to our nation, I am still hesitant to support them wholeheartedly. The negative outcomes of their projects still greatly affect their name."", 'Josef\nThe entire Cayetano family started off their journey on a clean slate and successfully rose to power. They‚Äôve been through a lot of ups and downs to gain power at a very young age. They implemented many programs for the betterment of the country although it had some flaws. Even though I highly value their services to the country, I get the feeling that I only support them a bit. When problems arise in their projects, it slowly tarnishes their name.', 'Raffy\nThe Cayetano family has done many things to improve the country, things which can make you say that they are great people and see how much they care for the country. Even after the controversies, you can see that they can still do good things despite their wrongdoings, I have to get credit because they were not a well-known political family but they still made a name in that area despite being new. They did good things for sure, but those good things do not outshine their wrongdoings to our country, therefore I cannot say I fully support them. They could have been a strong family with a lot of supporters, but due to the controversy and horrible outcomes of their projects, their name is already negatively affected to the point where it is hard to support them.', ""Steffan\nMuch like most other things, the Cayetano actually has it's generally good side and it's more questionable bad side. While it's actually had it's contributions, it's also had it's fair share of controversy with the whole BTS thing, the stand on the war on drugs, and others. Their contributions and the work that they've put into the country are definitely admirable and respectable, however, you cannot ignore their more questionable actions. I definitely commend them for their efforts, but that's about it. I do not personally support any individual, and hold a neutral stance towards the individuals themselves, nonetheless, I still support any movements I find reasonable and detest the more questionable decisions and actions."", 'Group Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we recognize the Cayetano Family‚Äôs contributions and political efforts for the betterment of society and praise them for making a name for themselves despite being younger compared to other political dynasties. On a personal level, however, we can say that we support their reasonable decisions, but we cannot really say that we support their dynasty or political members as a whole because they are not entirely ‚Äúclean‚Äù politicians.']"

504,globaltrustopedia,"['Phobia- is one of the most serious mental conditions where a person feels fear in a particular situation or a specific object.', 'According to A Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School, common phobias are related to fear of flying, heights, insects, animals, and injections, or usually the sight of blood. ', 'Corona- has derived from the new pandemic ‚Äòcoronavirus.‚Äô', 'The term coronaphobia emerged in 2020 as the pandemic triggered vastly in the world. During the lockdown phase, there are a lot of things that changed people‚Äôs lives in terms of social life, livelihood, economy, and most importantly, mental health. Apparently, mental health is not always a genetic bourn disorder; it is an outcome of various environmental factors.', 'Coronavirus is a new pandemic to this world that started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and due to contagious disease, it has taken over all over the place. Coronavirus has common symptoms like body ache, sore throat, cough, fever, loss of taste, and smell; however, the outcomes of covid 19 are not so common. Covid 19 infection can lead to death, and people with low immunity levels are more prone to detect coronavirus from others.

Besides, the world health organization has introduced a few guidelines to protect from covid 19, for instance, maintaining a 6ft distance, covering mouth and nose, constantly cleaning hands and clothes. For elders, pregnant ladies and children under 6 years old are not allowed to go out amid lockdown as their immunity level is completely lower than others, and fewer changes to cure covid19.

Therefore, you might get recovered from this disease, but there is also a higher probability of diagnosing covid 19 again.

The economy was all time low, many lost their jobs and many migrated due to loss of job and no place to live.', 'But even in this pandemic while facing the grave danger of becoming the number one in the infected by the virus, India did a very brilliant of holding the virus outbreak at bay, many necessary and important steps were taken in time which prevented the\xa0 death toll and the infected cases to a minimum. Here we will discuss about the 5 long term positive effects of COVID19.', ""1) A more digital economy\nDemonetization was the shock that pushed India into the digital era as people adopted online payments in the absence or short supply of cash. Covid-19 is the shock that is forcing everyone to adopt digital in everything ‚Äî from buying groceries to seeking online consultations with a doctor for minor conditions. \n\nIndia's total e-commerce shopper base, at 30% of its online population, is quite low when compared with 78% in China and over 70% in the US. In a 53-page report on 'India's Digital Economy in a Post-Covid-19 World', Morgan Stanley has projected that India's online shoppers will jump to 590 million from 190 million in 2020. The average spend per online shopper is also projected to nearly double\nto $318.\n\n2) Global supply chains will be redrawn\nChina has been the factory of the world for quite some time now and as a result it has become the pillar of global supply chains for everything from chips to drug APIs. The world has realized that it might not be a good idea to put all eggs in one basket. This would mean that countries like India that have long waited for their turn to make for the world would increasingly see more foreign businesses set up base and generate large scale employment.\n\n3) Policy reforms gathering pace\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led India to initiate reforms that have been stuck in red tape for decades. For instance, the government has liberalized the coal sector and changed certain labor laws that were said to have been hindering businesses. Moreover, the government has also announced \xa0agri market reforms such as bringing in legislation that will allow farmers to sell their produce to whoever they choose.\n\n4) Liquidity rush in the capital markets\nCentral banks all around the world have cut interest rates and launched borrowing programs to inject cash into the capital markets. The Reserve Bank of India came out with a plan in March to supply Rs 3.74 lakh crore of liquidity to the financial markets. While banks may have not been lending off the bat, their cash reserves ‚Äî coupled with low interest rates ‚Äî will mean that individuals and businesses will be afforded a huge breadth in borrowing once green shoots start to appear in the economy.   "", '5) Nature of jobs will be transformed\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to a lot of companies rethinking office spaces and on-site work. Tech bigwigs such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have already made announcements regarding giving staff the option to work from home in the long term.

621,tptruepolitics,"['I am writing this in response to a popular opinion piece that is making its way around, where a father from Fairfax County VA explains why he believes that children should not return to school in the fall. This article is deeply flawed in many ways, and as it is gaining in popularity - it‚Äôs even posted on a doctors website - I felt compelled to write my own opinion piece in response, in order to set the record straight on many of the issues he addresses. ', 'Here is one publishing of this opinion: https://morettiphd.wordpress.com/2020/07/12/one-parent-outlines-his-and-his-friends-choices-for-his-children-this-fall/', 'I will attempt to address all the points with which I have issue in some sort of an order. I do not have issue with all the points, however. So, suffice it to say that if I don‚Äôt mention it directly, I either make reference to it indirectly, or I don‚Äôt think it is incorrectly stated. To start off, I must address the main issue of the article first, as it informs the majority of the talking points. And there are two main issues with this point, so bear with me. Firstly, the number 302 is wrong.....by a factor of 100. The article states, and I quote, ‚ÄúChildren only die .0016 of the time,‚Äù and continues to say, ‚Äú[The] FCPS has 189,000 children. .0016 of that is 302.‚Äù So to start this explanation, I will begin with my assumption, which was that the article meant to read, ‚Äúchildren only die .0016 percent of the time.‚Äù This was a point of contention with responses I received regarding whether the number was already converted to numerical form, or whether it was in a percent. And still there were some people quoting the number incorrectly as .016. When you read the article, it indeed says, .0016. So, assuming that would be a percent, we must calculate what number .0016% of 189,000 is. The number is 3.02, not 302. When reverse calculating percentages, you need to divide by 100 before you multiply by the total case number. For example, 20% of a 100 is not 2,000, it‚Äôs 20. Because when you calculate the percentage, you need to convert 20% to 0.20, and then multiply it by the total. 0.20 x 100 = 20. In short, no, 3 kids are at risk, not 302.\xa0', 'That however assumes that this .0016% is correct at all. This number can be found a few places: 1), the Wikipedia page, titled ‚ÄúMortality due to COVID-19‚Äô, where it estimates the death rates of children based on cases from China. If we did not already undervalue the source, because it is Wikipedia, although I tend to trust Wikipedia more than it is often given credit for, we should be doubly skeptical of the data as its own source is one of the most dishonest governments in our world today. The second place one can find this is from a tweet from sports commentator, Clay Travis, dated July 6th, talking about the death rate of COVID patients who died under the age of 54. Assuming the death rate of COVID patients under the age of 20 would be even less than that for the state of Florida (and it is!), we already have two terrible sources for data that do not represent our population. The third source I have recently found is from an empirical study from Switzerland, attempting to find the infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19 patients of all ages, and their IFR for ages 5-9 was .0016. ', 'As far as the US is concerned at large, the way that the CDC is releasing its information about COVID deaths by age is poorly executed. For the rest of the world, and even most states, children‚Äôs deaths are being split into 2 or 3 categories, all ending at age 17, the last age before legal adulthood. This also happens to represent the majority of children in primary and secondary school systems. The CDC has decided to break from this norm and have a very odd age range from 15-24. This age range is skewing data, as far as school aged children are concerned and should be viewed with a healthy skepticism, as the older you get, the more susceptible to the virus and its effects you are. With that being said, from information on the CDC website, updated as of the week of July 11th, there have only been 188 deaths ages 0-24. While there is no specific information available currently about child infection rates, this represents 0.136% of the deaths (138,000) due to COVID. This data is likely skewed by the statistics coming out of New York (possibly 17), as they have had an unusually high number of deaths overall, mostly due to a combination of factors including how early on they were struck by the virus, lack of preparation, and overall lack of adequate responsiveness to the severity of the situation. As far as children under the age of 15, the death rates are even lower, marking only 33 deaths nationwide, which is 0.024% of COVID deaths in the US. ', ""\xa0If we are looking to find an accurate number for death rates among children, there was one major study done in the US, cited by the CDC, dated in April, observing case rates, hospitalization rates, ICU rates and death toll. They examined about 150,000 cases of the virus. Of those cases, only 1.7% were child cases (2,571). Approximately 73% experienced symptoms. Of those that had symptoms, approximately 20% were hospitalized. And of those that were hospitalized, there were 3 deaths. \nIn summary, 1.7% of the total cases were represented by children. \n73% (1,876) of those had symptoms. That's 1.3% of the total number of cases.\n20% (375) of those cases were hospitalized. That‚Äôs 14.5% of the child cases, but .25% of the total cases. \nThe 3 reported deaths represent 0.8% of those hospitalized, 0.117% of the child cases, and 0.002% of the total number of cases."", '\xa0I will not say that this research is definitive or even conclusive, but it does share a valuable piece of information with the reader: children are not dying of this virus at significant enough rate to close down schools. This is especially indicative of lower death rates among children, because testing has significantly increased since this study was done. ', ""\xa0The death rate of children is the most important statistic to take away from this. And this is very close to the number given in the article above (way to go China!). But to calculate with the correct number for the above article, 0.002% of 189,000 is about 4. If we're talking about infection rate, then yes, it would be closer to 3,200. And if we're talking about hospitalization rate, about 643. \nBut deaths are the minority, and the number we should be focusing on in my opinion."", '\xa0Here is some additional data from the US: Massachusetts with over 8,300 deaths has had 0 under the age of 18. California has had 0 deaths in that same age range. Florida appears to have had 2-3 deaths in that age range. New Jersey, 2. Texas, 0. Internationally, the entire country of Canada has had only 1 death under 18, with a case count of almost 8,000 child cases. ', ""\xa0I think the most important source for data on how children are faring with Coronavirus is the data coming out of Sweden. Some people have commented that the statistics involving children and COVID in the US and other nations are not entirely reliable, because the US and most other nations shut down their schools as a precaution to ensure the safety of their children. In this way, it is unfair to compare the common flu, which kills between 50 and 250 children each year, to coronavirus as we have not experienced a ‚Äúflu-like season‚Äù with COVID. This article even claims that children were not experiencing an accurate number of caseloads as compared to adults, because the schools were shut down early. First of all, this is a ridiculous misrepresentation of the facts. NYC announced they would close down schools March 15 and non-essential businesses on March 20. That‚Äôs a period of five days. That‚Äôs not a huge difference. By March 25, there were over 17,000 confirmed cases, and almost 200 dead. The virus had been spreading long before they shut down the schools or the businesses. There was a spike in cases across the board; essential work related groups being affected the most. Police, EMTs, doctors, they all started to see increased cases after that; much more than the rest of the population. Non-essential workers also saw a spike, lesser, but still a spike, where children did not see such a dramatic uptick. Children were also at home with their parents, from whom they may have contracted the virus. If children were so vulnerable to this virus, wouldn't it make sense that if the parents had it, they'd pass it to their kids? The numbers don't say they did, though. And when they did pass them on, the children only exhibited mild to no symptoms, with certain exceptions. Also, as has been pointed out, none of this is the case for Sweden. Sweden had largely left their schools open for the entire duration of the virus and has had only 1 death under the age of 20, with an infection count slightly under 4,000 for that same group. "", '\xa0I will get more specific. As far as infection rate goes, dated July 4th, so far, Sweden has had 76,000 (updated today) infections nationwide, which sounds low, but is actually about .76% of their population. As their testing continues to increase, this percentage should as well. The US has a little under 3.48 million cumulative cases, which sounds like a lot, but for a country that is 30 times larger than Sweden, it is only about 1% of our population, a similar number that is sure to rise with increased testing as well. And as we have increased our testing more than most of the world, we are likely to reveal more cases than other countries. So, statistically we have not reached the end of our term with the virus. But we are in par with other European countries. \n\nAs for children (<20) Sweden has the data split into 2 groups, which I will show, and also combine. <9 is 441 cases, and 10-19 is 2,875. Collectively, 3,516, which is 4.62% of the coronavirus case pool (76,000). As Sweden continues to test, it is reasonable to assume that this number will go down collectively, as you can see in the data, the youngest children are much less represented. \nOf the general population though, 3,516 only represents 0.035% of the population at large (over 10 million).\n\nI think, especially since Sweden left their schools open largely, and Sweden is more likely to be completely transparent with their data than some other countries, we can look to Sweden for realistic infection data across the board.\n\nAs far as hospitalization, so far I have only been able to find a statistic that tells me about intensive cases. Of the 76,000 cases in Sweden, only 2,484 have been sent to intensive care - a little less than 3.3% of cases. Of the total population, that is less than 0.025%. These numbers seem on par with the study you sent about the US cases and hospital records.\nIt stands to reason that if hospitalization rates and ICU rates are that low all toll, then those for children, 90% of whom in the US have seen moderate to no symptoms at all, are lower still.', ""\xa0Now, to the point about trading children‚Äôs lives for a better learning environment: children (yes, children, I'm not including adults), are at less risk to corona than to the common flu. While, whoever said ‚Äúthe flu kills more people every year‚Äù does need to get their head checked, the majority of people aren‚Äôt saying such things. And worldwide, this virus is killing fewer children than the flu does, even on an average year. Remember, the flu kills between 50 and 250 children in the US alone per year, and flu season runs right through our normal school year. We don't shut down school for flu season. As a matter of fact, no one has even proposed shifting the school year to times of year that would lower the risk of kids to flu exposure. It‚Äôs not even an agenda, because that would be insane! Certainly, we have shut down schools for outbreaks of the flu, but those are exceptions, not the rule. We don‚Äôt have these types of responses for other instances where are children are at increased statistical risk. Younger drivers are notorious for getting into the most car accidents. We don‚Äôt refuse to let our children learn how to drive until they are 30. Why don‚Äôt we? They could easily take public transit and ride services when we are unavailable to drive them ourselves. Why aren‚Äôt we protecting our children from this dangerous activity? The reason is that the risk is worth it for the potential benefits. Young adults often need to go places that public transit can‚Äôt take them. Lift services are expensive and sometimes a bit shady. The independence of driving on their own allows them to learn valuable life lessons and enhances their freedoms. We take risks every day as we take our kids out of the home, more often than not, not so heavily calculated, because if we did the calculations like we're doing here, we'd be afraid to take our kids into the bathroom for fear of drowning in our tubs! I reject the sentiment that exposing our kids to these risks makes society or parents unreasonable, irresponsible or bad. It makes them understanding of the world around them. Children can't grow without taking risks. Undue risks, when presented, certainly must be mitigated as much as possible, but this is not one.\xa0If my child dies of the flu, I won‚Äôt be marching around advocating for school term rearrangements. Likewise, the coronavirus and its minimal risks to our children shouldn‚Äôt terrify us into mediocrity for our educational system. So, no, no one's children are being sacrificed; no one need volunteer their children for the proverbial chopping block of COVID. Stop fear mongering, because it's useless and cruel to your children"", '\xa0I have a few points on the objectivity-absent terminology. ""Released from the hospital"" means exactly that. It implies, however, that you are no longer at such a severe health risk that you need to be monitored 24/7. ""No longer infected"" also means exactly what it says. No one has claimed there wouldn\'t be long-term effects of a virus that attacks you. When has anyone ever assumed that? Dozens of diseases have similar long-term effects even after infection has passed. Neither of these points, nor the anecdotes changes the fact that most people DO recover. Most people, who survive this virus, have little to no long-term effects. These people without long-term effects are the one who were less symptomatic to begin with, yes, but those are most people, I should specify. The fewer symptoms you have, the less likely you are to have long-term effects. The ones who are more likely to have long-term effects are also the ones more likely to contract and die from it. So, the older you are, the more likely you are to get, have symptoms from, and have long-term effects from said virus. Children, to reiterate, who are less likely to contract and have symptoms of the virus, are thereby even less likely to have any long-term effects. And children are the focus of this debate, no? Not adults? That\'s what I thought.', '\xa0So, let‚Äôs talk about long-term effects in children. The only currently observed ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù effect in cases involving children is what is called Kawasaki Syndrome, originally known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome. This syndrome however, is extremely rare. To be clear, this particular condition is actually not classified as Kawasaki Syndrome, but Kawasaki-like in many ways. But for the purposes of this discussion we can treat them virtually the same. Kawasaki Syndrome is a condition that is uncommon in the world at large, affecting only children under the age of 5 at extremely low rates. Uofmhealth.org stated in an article, ""The disease is rare, affecting 9 to 20 per 100,000 children under age five in the U.S. It‚Äôs more frequently diagnosed in Japan and among Asian-American populations.""\n9-20 per 100,000 children under the age of 5. In percentages, that\'s 0.009% - 0.02% of children under the age of 5. This is a very small subset of the population, and an especially small subset of the subset of children. \nSo, it is exceedingly rare, but what about long-term, you might be asking. This same article (I\'ll put a link), tells us, ‚Äú‚ÄòEarly treatment usually prevents severe heart problems, and most children don‚Äôt experience long term health issues from Kawasaki disease, says Mott pediatric cardiologist Gabe Owens, M.D., Ph.D.‚Äô‚Äù \nI know the word ""recover"" has been under some scrutiny, but for this particular case, Kawasaki Syndrome has been around for a while, and doctors have been able to successfully treat it as long as it is caught relatively early on. So, when they say ""recover"", they mean it. \nThe Kawasaki-like condition appears to develop as an immuno-response to COVID, as opposed to being a symptom of COVID. \nHere\'s the article link: https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/.../rare-covid-related...\n\nAs far as the spread of COVID is concerned, children have been reported to not be significant sources of spread for the virus in multiple promising studies worldwide. I would actually like to defer this part of the discussion to an article that better explains this than me (very important, and short read): https://theconversation.com/yes-weve-seen-schools-close-but-the-evidence-still-shows-kids-are-unlikely-to-catch-or-spread-coronavirus-141445 \nI think a lot of the media is downplaying the significance of the studies listed in this article. This indicates that if you should chose to send your children to school, that there will not be a significant risk in your children bringing the virus home with them should you have vulnerable people living at home. There are certain populations where they have multiple generations living at home. For these families, perhaps it would be better if the parents opted to keep the children home for Zoom classes. Grandparents, if they are capable can be a relief of stress in that they can help out with the students‚Äô classwork without significantly impacting the work schedules of the parents. This would be an ‚Äúair on the side of caution‚Äù mitigation of any risk to their grandparents.\n\nAs for teachers, I have said this before in this thread, but I don\'t want to make you search for it. Despite the evidence that suggests that children are at a low risk for transmitting the disease, I still think it would be responsible to keep our teachers safe. My proposal for this is actually very simple. Students will attend school as usual. Some communities may feel safer reducing the number of students in a classroom, that\'s fine. Another good idea is increased hand washing with specific times for it. Masks are unreasonable and far less likely to effective in children as it is, and that is despite their already low propensity for infection and symptoms. As far as socialization goes, given that children are far less likely to contract the virus, far less likely to have symptoms of the virus, and far less likely to die from the virus, I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb here and say, yes, children should be allowed to socialize normally. They should be able to sit at lunchroom tables together, play on the playground together, and sit in the classrooms in regular seating arrangements. No sharing your Lunchables, but overall I think the student experience should be relatively normal. \nFor the teachers, though, we don\'t want them needlessly exposing themselves, especially if they are not willing to expose themselves or others. Instead, for those teachers that are unwilling or unable to attend the class in person, a teacher‚Äôs assistant (younger than 25 to reduce risk) will proctor the class and monitor their behavior and guide them through activities and assist with classwork. The teachers themselves can be Zoomed in to administer the class from a safe distance. That way all the students are able to learn in a healthy and productive environment and our teachers stay safe.\n\nThis may cost a little more money from the state as far as educational budgets are concerned, but I believe it is a fair and reasonable compromise for our teachers and students that does not compromise anyone\'s health or the students‚Äô quality of education in any serious way. ', 'Comparing classroom environments to conference rooms or retail workspaces is intellectually dishonest. ', 'This is a serious flaw in this logic. If you asked a bunch of adults if they want to get in conference rooms together for 45 minutes, of course they‚Äôre going to say no. Adults (meaning older ages) are far more likely to be affected by COVID than children. That would be an unreasonable risk in the scenarios when the exact same job could be done from home. As for retail, neither classrooms nor conference rooms are more dangerous than retail work environments. This was a ridiculous contention. Let me explain something about retail. Supermarkets are retail, certainly. And yes those rooms are huge, and most stores have a capacity limit on current shoppers. With the exception of Supermarkets and department stores, most retail stores are small. Some are no bigger than a small lecture hall. Some are smaller than classrooms. I\'ll tell you, it is NOT a job you want during a pandemic. Nevertheless, none of those factors matter to the virus. Retail workers handle money (germs), rewards cards (germs), touch surfaces (germs) and actually have to breathe from time to time (germs). Gloves? Well, they aren‚Äôt fool proof. They rip and need to be changed. Not changing gloves frequently enough is common. Touching surfaces without gloves can happen. Constant washing of hands and wearing gloves makes skin raw, and it can crack and develop cuts, which could increase the risk of infection. Thankfully, the virus isn‚Äôt known to transfer from surface contact as much. We have those social distancing procedures and Plexiglas in front. Have you been in a store in the past 3 months? The 6ft guidelines are regularly broken due to crowding, asking questions, and people just passing each other. The Plexiglas: it‚Äôs a spit guard. Spit guards protect people from spit‚Ä¶that‚Äôs it. They are NOT effective at reducing the spread of infection except in instances where people are spitting on you, but as long as you‚Äôre wearing a mask, that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem anyway. As a matter of fact, the CDC states that personal face shields are virtually useless against the spread of infection. So, what‚Äôs the main issue? Well, customers come and go, sure, but the nano-particles that they leave behind stay in the building long after they leave. So, when one hundred customers come in and leave, and the next hundred come and leave, and the next hundred come and leave, the nano-particles from the first group are still there. Now you have the nano-particles of 300-400 people in this environment, floating around possibly inflecting others. This is especially true in air-conditioned environments without outside air recirculation. Nano-particles are sometimes capable of remaining in the air for 8 hours after their host leaves. So, this brings us to the masks! Everyone is on the mask craze. You‚Äôre stupid if you don‚Äôt wear one and you‚Äôre saving the world if you do. How much of this is actually true? Well, the CDC has research about the masks and the various materials being used to make such masks, and how they perform, comparatively. They concluded that homemade masks have the ""potential"" to lower the risk of contracting COVID. That\'s a paraphrase, but the word ""potential"" is used specifically, because they are not fool proof. I read up about these, because I wanted to understand what type of risks I\'m encountering. The evidence is scary. Unless you have a mask without any gaps (a tight fitting mask), most of the homemade masks are only between 10 and 45% effective at reducing the chance of infection within the margins of error, depending on the material combinations. There are possibly 3 combinations that are effective enough to significantly reduce the chance of infection, but most masks are not made up of these combinations. Additionally, when there are gaps in your mask, even of the smallest size, the efficiency rate for all the masks, no matter the material goes down below 40%. Even N95 masks ‚Äì yes, the most famous masks in the world, now ‚Äì and other surgical masks go down to a 60% effective rate, if they are not worn properly or are not properly fitting. All in all, the average mask is feel good effort at best in most circumstances. This is not an argument against wearing them. Certainly, most masks of any material are effective at preventing macro droplets from escaping, and that is significant enough, but we should not fool ourselves into a false sense of security. So, children have an extremely low chance of dying from COVID, an extremely low chance of contracting it, and an equally low chance of passing it to others. However, a retail worker may ordinarily have an increased chance of catching COVID due to their working conditions and regular interactions with the general public. Now, if a retail worker is older, they are more likely to experience adverse effects, which make my point for me, but let‚Äôs say they‚Äôre younger: 16 ‚Äì 25. Many workers in that age range, live with their parents. They may even be asymptomatic, but are likely to be carriers to their parents, who are at higher risk and have a higher probability of death. All of a sudden, retail doesn‚Äôt sound so safe, now does it? I\'d say comparing retail jobs and schools reveals that they‚Äôre not even close in risk level.', '\xa0Some people have attempted to brush off COVID as not as dangerous or not that important, which as you can tell from the extent of the research I‚Äôve done, those are contentions with which I do not agree. We can all appreciate the severity of the issue at hand and still come up with different solutions to the problems we face. ', '\xa0This article has made mention of a few of these ridiculous brushoffs, and I don‚Äôt think they accurately represent the majority of the population and weren‚Äôt appropriate to include, but I will address them anyway.', '\xa0""People get sick"" Well, for my part, I don\'t mean other people. I mean me. Yeah, I get sick. You get sick, we all get sick. It\'s a fact of life. While this uncultivated statement grossly underplays the current situation (a point I will concede), I fail to understand how it truly relates to the topic. Frankly, I\'m not looking for an explanation. I understand that it\'s something some dunderhead mentioned and you took it as an explanation for why they didn\'t care about other people. It sounds really good to retort in a rant, but it\'s not really relevant. I think a more accurate and more sensitive point would be that spreading the virus to those less vulnerable helps us on the path to herd immunity. That was the initial goal, right? The more people who get ""sick"" and are less susceptible to symptoms, the better the situation is actually. I put sick in quotes because asymptomatic people can hardly be considered sick, and can only be noted because of carrier status. So, allowing our children to contract the virus when they are least vulnerable instead of waiting on some unknown day to come when we might have a vaccine when they also might be more vulnerable. . . That\'s just bad parenting, honestly. If my son at age 7 has a 0.002% chance of death by contracting a virus. But he may contract it at age 38 if we never have a vaccine, and by then he may have a 6% chance of death for example, then...yeah! I\'m willing to risk him getting it now! The odds only get worse with time! So, more aptly put, people will get sick eventually. Our children will come in contact with this virus more likely than not. Wouldn‚Äôt it be wiser to risk their exposure when they are in their least vulnerable demographic?', '\xa0""I\'m not going to live my life in fear"" ', ""Well, this is another innocuous statement that really doesn't bear too much weight on the argument at hand, but watch me twist it to my favor since the writer decided to. You're right, children don't have the luxury of whether to live in fear or not. They live in fear of many things already: spiders, the dark, loneliness, bullying, etc. Why add something else to the list when we don't need to? Children have no chance of dying from a common house spider ‚Äì none; it‚Äôs a common house spider ‚Äì but they fear them. Do you encourage that irrational fear? If you do, you are perpetuating a fear that need not exist. Children have virtually (I said virtually) no chance of dying from COVID either. Do you terrify them with stories of other children dying from the flu? No? They are more likely to die from it! Oh, you just tell them to wash their hands and not to lick doorknobs? Well, how irresponsible of you, no? "", 'Why terrify our children from something that is less likely to harm them than the flu, when we don‚Äôt do the same for the flu? Once again, it‚Äôs fear mongering and it‚Äôs needless and cruel. ', '\xa0""I talked it over with my kids"" ', 'Well, this is something that the writer and I might agree on. I generally don‚Äôt believe that parents should defer to their children for any sort of life-altering decision-making. Although I can think of many concepts that some parents think are perfectly acceptable to heed the words of their children blindly, I digress. There is a decent point to be made with regards to talking to your children. I firmly believe that children are capable of handling hard truths. They are surprisingly resilient. Explaining the current situation and being honest about their risks and what they can do to mitigate them can have a profound effect on your children. ', ""Lastly, I want to address more of the burdens ‚Äì financial, mental stress, emotional turmoil ‚Äì in a community. This is the last factor I'm talking about because I want to show I am putting life before quality of life. "", 'One main reason why going completely virtual in the classroom is a bad idea, is that there are many reports of students NOT attending these virtual classes, and even when they are, they are not focusing. Now, maybe there can be mitigations and improvements made to the system to ensure proper learning. Yes. Fine. Wonderful. But where are these ideas? Very few, if any, seem to be addressing them!', 'The most pressing issue concerning children returning to school are parents. Parents, who may also be working from home at the moment, are unable to babysit their children to make sure they do assignments and make sure they pay attention during class. Some students are turning in ""completed"" assignments, assuming the teachers aren\'t actually checking them, but that they are only checking that the assignments are ""completed"". So, the point saying that children don\'t want to go back to school is actually true. Most children aren\'t really a huge fan of school at all, having been a child myself at one point, having child friends, and understanding children in general having worked with them before. Although, my anecdotal evidence is by no means proof, all you need to do is consult a survey of children\'s favorite subjects and notice gym or recess being listed most to understand this concept. So, when they get to stay at home and pretend to learn and go along with the motions to make a teacher who isn\'t there happy, I\'d say, yeah, they\'re having their cake and eating it too. But in your own words, ‚Äúthe concept of adults effectively deferring this decision to children, the same children who will continue to stuff things into a full trash can rather than change it out‚Äù is asinine. ‚ÄúKids are not mature enough for this moment.‚Äù (also you). And you‚Äôre right. They need constant guidance and discipline in the form of a classroom environment. And now, despite presuming that all parents have the type of freedoms and personal time to dedicate hours on end to their children‚Äôs education while working from home, to add insult to injury, are we to assume that when parents go back to work, and they undoubtedly will eventually, you are suggesting that they will magically have the ability to be in two places at once? Who will watch their kids from home? Should the schools stay closed and virtual classrooms are the new normal for the foreseeable future, this could bring unnecessary financial burdens on families who do not have the luxury of staying home with their children on a normal basis. Families in lower income brackets have been out of work largely for months, and although the federal and state governments have been compensating them, as they should, this is not sustainable for the foreseeable future. If both parents need to work in order to support their families but one is forced not to because they have to watch their children, who does that disproportionately affect: low-income, inner city, blue-collar workers. Nannies are not an option, because they would offset any of the additional wages made by the second parent going back to work. These are the parents that cannot work from home: retail workers, salons, movie theaters, many waitresses and waiters that have been furloughed due to the virus, which account for the lowest income brackets. If they are forced to keep their children at home, they will be unable to leave their houses as well, reducing their incomes. \nWhere will this extra money come from? The government cannot be expected to adequately compensate these parents. The government can hardly be expected to adequately do anything. Not to mention, that would increase taxes in these neighborhoods and across the country astronomically. \nInstead, increase the budget slightly to support the increased precautions in our education system, allowing students the chance to go back to school and parents the opportunity to get back to supporting their families. So, yes, open schools to their full abilities, giving parents the option to keep their kids home if they are truly worried about their safety or the safety of older generations in the household. Also, give teachers the option to Zoom into the classroom with a young teacher‚Äôs aide assisting in the classroom to ensure their personal health. For the rest of the population, getting back to a certain level of normalcy wouldn‚Äôt just be a welcome relief from this nightmare, but a responsible and compassionate option for those in our communities who need the resources of education, time, and opportunity the most. And I haven‚Äôt even mentioned how many experts are concerned about domestic violence incidents increasing and not getting reported. Or the rising fears of suicide rates increasing. While there is no way to know at the current time whether these fear will bear fruit or not, they are worth mentioning nonetheless. ', '\xa0  To address one final point: this person has said they presume no expertise, and I commend the honesty in that regard. However, claiming you are not an expert does not diminish the effects or reach of your opinion. No matter your good intentions, people like you are flooding the information pool with mere conjecture instead of fact-based evidentiary propositions. Your ideas are nothing more than how you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù about the situation, but many people will read your words and see them as common sense arguments, with which they may make irreversible decisions on account of their child‚Äôs education. They will assume that you are making your statements based on at least some knowledge of the situation. It appears however that they would be misled, as most of your points are baseless, emotionally charged, or simply irrelevant. Is it their fault that they do not pursue the actual data? I will say no, because with such a flood of misinformation and differing sources of credibility, it is becoming exponentially difficult to weed out the good from the bad. Opinion pieces like this ‚Äì uninformed and emotionally charged ‚Äì are not the exception, but largely the rule from what I‚Äôve seen. It‚Äôs about time that people who claim ‚Äúno expertise‚Äù leave the debate to those who do claim expertise. This will allow the flood of information, muddied by emotions and good-intentions to be reduced to a trickle of well-researched, well thought out, level-headed and credible sources. I hope you appreciate all the thought I have put into this, as I truly believe it is the best way forward for everyone. ', 'As always, let me know if I missed anything. Tell me what you think?

We were practicing our choir performance for the moving up ceremony. It was fun and all of us were exhilarated thinking about the new journey that awaits us. I remembered that Covid-19 was a hot topic on the news and it was just 1-3 cases of coronavirus entering our country. All of us didn‚Äôt take it seriously because no one predicted nor expected that a pandemic would happen to our world.', 'The news stated that there will be a 2 week lockdown. I was at my Tita‚Äôs home when the lockdown was implemented. It was alarming thinking that we can‚Äôt travel and get out of our homes. During the first month of lockdown, I didn‚Äôt feel how dangerous the virus was. I just felt like the news was exaggerating the reports and those who are weak, vulnerable, and have illness are the ones who were badly affected.', 'When I got home, the clustering was implemented. We have a store at the public market and there was a peak of customers at that time because the color-coding clustering was administered in the mall. The clustered barangays flocked to the malls so the people preferred to buy their needs at the public market.

No one knows how long we will live. That is why spending our precious time with our loved ones is crucial. I also observed that many people have lost their jobs and businesses. It made me grasp the thought that choosing the right career and job is important so that when a pandemic or lockdown happens, you can still be able to earn and provide for yourself and your family.', 'Amid the pandemic, people never fail to show compassion and unity. Community Pantries circulated around the country to share their blessings and to be able to help those in need. It was heartwarming to see the good in other people. An act of goodness can be a big help to someone.', 'My family was blessed because we didn‚Äôt get positive from the virus. There are times when we feel unwell but we just did all the home remedies to avoid COVID19. Thankfully, it was not a serious illness and we quickly recovered from it. We only went out of the house if it was necessary and we followed the government protocols.

Palliative treatments, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radioembolization (TARE) have been maintained in selected patients, in order to optimize the risk-benefit ratio, by minimizing risks related to hospitalization. ', 'Although considered safe procedures, these palliative treatments are associated with generally underestimated complications. ', 'Here we report the case of a 78-year-old patient who developed respiratory failure after TACE procedure while being hospitalized during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) outbreak. Clinical decisions and outcomes are therefore described.', 'Keywords: TACE; Chemical Pneumonia; Hepatocellular Carcinoma; COVID 19; Respiratory Failure', 'Abbreviations: SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2; HCC: Hepatocellular Carcinoma; TACE: Transarterial Chemoembolization; TARE: Transarterial Radioembolization; CPT: Child-Pugh Turcotte; HCV: Hepatitis C Virus; LUF: Lipiodol Ultrafluid; EPI: Epirubicin; CT: Computed Tomography; AFP: Alpha-fetoprotein; S: Segment; Sat: Saturation; COVID-19: Coronavirus Disease', 'Introduction', 'A 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with multifocal recurrence of a previously resected HCC on compensated (CPT-A) cirrhosis due to untreated Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. She could not benefit from Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAA), since in Italy treatment is currently not reimbursed in patients with active HCC outside liver transplant waiting list. She had no comorbidities, and TACE was planned by our multidisciplinary team. After the first c-TACE [Lipiodol ultrafluid (LUF) plus Epirubicin (EPI)], abdomen CT-scan showed three residual nodules [11 mm in liver segment (S) 7, 10 mm in S5 and 10 mm in S6] with typical HCC pattern and Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) lowering from 260 to 85 ng/mL. The next TACE procedure occurred to be planned during peaking Italian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the very beginning of April 2020. The patient was still motivated to undertake HCC treatment, aware of the risks associated with current pandemic, albeit mitigated by protocols implemented in our Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-free department. She underwent two SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs, 5 and 3 days before hospital admission, which both tested negative. At admission, blood tests showed mildly increased liver enzymes, however with normal bilirubin and liver function tests.', 'Case Report', 'After checking S7, S6 and S5 lesions vascular supply, the hypertrophic right inferior phrenic artery was selectively catheterized, and LUF 2 mg emulsified with EPI 5 mg was injected (Figures 1a,1b). TACE procedure was immediately interrupted due to appearance of not previously described pulmonary shunts (Figure 1c). ', 'Thereafter, HCCs were treated with standard doses of LUF and EPI through the right hepatic artery. No adverse events related to TACE were recorded, during and immediately after the procedure. Twenty hours later, the patient presented with fever (38.0¬∞C) and desaturation (SatO2 78%), in absence of pronounced dyspnea. Arterial blood gas analysis showed respiratory failure with pH 7.40, pO2 34, pCO2 49, SpO2 65%, lactates 1.2, P/F 161. Differential diagnosis was made. Acute Respiratory Failure should prompt a rapid evaluation and physicians are required to quickly rule out the most common acute pulmonary pathologies. Acquired infectious pneumonia is quite a common cause of rapid deteriorating respiratory function and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Among infectious pneumonia, due to current high incidence scenario with rapidly spreading intra-hospital potential outbreaks, COVID-19 should be the first pathology to be excluded in order to keep infected patients out of SARS-CoV-2 free departments and, on the other hand, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 negative patients to become ill. Although our patient had been tested for COVID-19 before hospital admission, high rates of false negative RT-PCR tests should suggest to keep a low threshold for re-testing, especially if we take into consideration our subject‚Äôs clinical presentation with fever, acute respiratory failure and the absence of frank dyspnea which are all clinical characteristics of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.Also, in this specific case, pulmonary venous thromboembolism should be suspected given the sudden desaturation and considering the hypercoagulable state due to active cancer, the post-procedural bed confinement and the recent vascular maneuvers. ', 'Furthermore, the accidental injection of LUF + EPI into not previously known pulmonary shunt should raise the suspicion of possible adverse events related to the injection of relatively high doses of iodinated contrast agents into pulmonary parenchyma thus provoking chemical pneumonia. Oxygen support was then delivered (VM 50% 12 l/min), with benefit. Blood tests were repeated and they revealed unchanged white blood cells count (3,780/mm3), with relatively low lymphocytes (10%); hemoglobin, C-Reactive Protein, D-Dimer and ferritin were normal. ', 'Chest X-ray showed an interstitial lung reinforcement and a possible basal right pneumonia. Due to parallel high incidence clinical scenario and the radiologic findings, a third SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab was obtained, which still tested negative. To rule out the other possible complications, the patient underwent chest CT-scan which revealed the presence of radio-opaque material within the apical and posterior segment of the lower right lobe, that was suggestive for lipiodol accumulation (Figures 2a,2b). Liver accumulation were as well noted (Figure 2c). Right basal pneumonia was not confirmed, despite the presence of mild pleural effusion and lobar dystelectasia. Both antibiotics and low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis were started, and patient‚Äôs respiratory function was closely monitored. The patient experienced a progressive improvement in respiratory function with oxygen weaning after 7 days, and was discharged without sequelae.

Due to her high motivation, the absence of major comorbidities, as well as the decrease in AFP values following previous HCC treatments, the patient was hospitalized despite several difficulties related to the concomitant peak of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Milan, Italy [1]. In order to minimize the risk of nosocomial infection, she had previously undergone two SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs, which tested negative. However, the onset of desaturation in absence of respiratory symptoms led physicians to reconsider COVID-19, due to the current high-risk clinical scenario. In fact, it has been recognized that several factors may limit molecular assays accuracy [2], with false negative rates of nearly 30%. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is crucial when interpreting swab results, thus making patient history collection essential, especially in the current ‚ÄúCOVID-19 era‚Äù [3]. Also, the presence of liver diseases may increase the risk of unfavorable SARS-CoV-2 infection [4]. ', 'Our patient reported a rare complication of TACE, ranging between 0.05%-4.5% [5]. In fact, patients undergoing multiple TACE can develop collateral vessels, arising from non-hepatic arteries. Interestingly, S7 and S8 can be supplied by the right inferior phrenic artery, which accounts for 62-83% of extrahepatic collaterals. Moreover, naturally present pulmonary shunts could significantly increase. Although demonstrated that in these cases TACE remains a safe procedure, infused ethiodized oils or chemotherapeutic agents could shunt into lung vessels, with chemical injury being further worsened by the consequent inflammatory response. Despite both LUF and EPI had been injected at lower than standard doses following the identification of previously unrecognized pulmonary shunts, their quantity was probably enough to cause subsequent pulmonary inflammation and respiratory failure.', 'Although is strongly advisable to ‚Äúthink of horses not zebras, when you hear hoof beats‚Äù, this case reminds us to keep an open-minded approach even in specific pandemic high incidence scenarios.', 'Funding', 'This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.', 'Ethical Approval', 'Approval was obtained from the local ethics committee.', 'Consent for Publication', 'The Author transfers to Springer the non-exclusive publication rights and he/she warrants that his/her contribution is original and that he/she has full power to make this grant.
